"Table is grouped by perceptual domain of the target stimulus. Within each domain, studies are grouped by domain type. Within domain type studies are sorted by year.  Effect sizes are coded such that positive effect sizes denote less sensitivity to context in SCZ and negative values denote more sensitivity to context in SCZ. Target stimulus location was coded as foveal if the participants were alllowed to freely view the stimuli and coded as peripheral if participants fixated away from the target stimuli.  λ = wavelength. Sim.
