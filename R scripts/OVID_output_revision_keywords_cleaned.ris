AB  - Visual illusions have long been used to study visual perception and contextual integration. Neuroimaging studies employ illusions to identify the brain regions involved in visual perception and how they interact. We conducted an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis and meta-analytic connectivity modeling on fMRI studies using static and motion illusions to reveal the neural signatures of illusory processing and to investigate the degree to which different areas are commonly recruited in perceptual inference. The resulting networks encompass ventral and dorsal regions, including the inferior and middle occipital cortices bilaterally in both types of illusions. The static and motion illusion networks selectively included the right posterior parietal cortex and the ventral premotor cortex respectively. Overall, these results describe a network of areas crucially involved in perceptual inference relying on feed-back and feed-forward interactions between areas of the ventral and dorsal visual pathways. The same network is proposed to be involved in hallucinogenic symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia and other disorders, with crucial implications in the use of illusions as biomarkers.

AB  - Perceptual distortions are core features of psychosis. Weakened contrast surround suppression has been proposed as a neural mechanism underlying atypical perceptual experiences. Although previous work has measured suppression by asking participants to report the perceived contrast of a low-contrast target surrounded by a high-contrast surround, it is possible to modulate perceived contrast solely by manipulating the orientation of a matched-contrast center and surround. Removing the bottom-up segmentation cue of contrast difference and isolating orientation-dependent suppression may clarify the neural processes responsible for atypical surround suppression in psychosis. We examined surround suppression across a spectrum of psychotic psychopathology including people with schizophrenia (PSZ; N = 31) and people with bipolar disorder (PBD; N = 29), first-degree biological relatives of these patient groups (PBDrel, PSZrel; N = 28, N = 21, respectively), and healthy controls (N = 29). PSZ exhibited reduced surround suppression across orientations; although group differences were minimal at the condition that produced the strongest suppression. PBD and PSZrel exhibited intermediate suppression, whereas PBDrel performed most similarly to controls. Intriguingly, group differences in orientation-dependent surround suppression magnitude were moderated by visual acuity. A simulation in which visual acuity and/or focal attention interact with untuned gain control reproduces the observed pattern of results, including the lack of group differences when orientation of center and surround are the same. Our findings further elucidate perceptual mechanisms of impaired center-surround processing in psychosis and provide insights into the effects of visual acuity on orientation-dependent suppression in PSZ.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia show impairment in binding stimulus features into coherent objects, which are reflected in disturbed oscillatory activities. This study aimed to identify disturbances in multiple oscillatory bands during perceptual organization of motion perception in patients with schizophrenia. EEG was recorded from healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia during continuous presentation of a motion stimulus which induces reversals between two exogenously generated perceptions. This stimulus was used to investigate differences in motion binding processes between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. EEG signals were transformed into frequency components by means of the Morlet wavelet transformation in order to analyse inter-trial coherences (ITC) in the delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency bands during exogenous motion binding. Patients showed decreased delta-ITC in occipital and theta-ITC in central and parietal areas, while no significant differences were found for neither alpha nor gamma-ITCs. The present study provides one of the first insights on the oscillatory synchronizations related with the motion perception in schizophrenia. The ITC differences revealed alterations in the consistency of large-scale integration and transfer functions in patients with schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2022.

AB  - PURPOSE. Center-surround contrast suppression-typically induced when a center pattern is surrounded by another pattern with similar spatial features-is considered a perceptual analogue of center-surround neurophysiology in the visual system. Surround suppression strength is altered in a range of brain conditions affecting young people (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, migraine) and is modulated by various neurotransmitters. The early teen years are associated with neurotransmitter changes in the human visual cortex, which could impact on excitation-inhibition balance and center-surround antagonistic effects. Hence, we predict that early adolescence is associated with perceptual changes in center-surround suppression. METHODS. In this cross-sectional study, we tested 196 students at every age from 10 to 17 years and 30 adults (aged 21-34 years) to capture the preteen, adolescent, and adult periods. Contrast discrimination thresholds were measured for a central, circular, vertical sinusoidal grating pattern (0.67degree radius, 2 cyc/deg spatial frequency, 2 deg/s drift rate) with and without the surround (4degree radius, otherwise same spatial properties as the center). Individual suppression strength was determined by comparing the perceived contrast of the target with and without the surround. RESULTS. After excluding unreliable data (7% of total), we found an effect of age on perceptual center-surround contrast suppression strength, F(8,201) = 2.30, P = 0.02, with weaker suppression in the youngest adolescents relative to adults (Bonferroni pairwise comparisons between adults vs 12-year-olds P = 0.01; adults vs 13-year-olds P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS. Our data demonstrate different center-surround interactions in the visual system-a key building block for visual perception-in early adolescence relative to adulthood.Copyright 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Visual perception is abnormal in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. In addition to hallucinations, laboratory tests show differences in fundamental visual processes including contrast sensitivity, center-surround interactions, and perceptual organization. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain visual dysfunction in psychotic disorders, including an imbalance between excitation and inhibition. However, the precise neural basis of abnormal visual perception in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP) remains unknown. Here, we describe the behavioral and 7 tesla MRI methods we used to interrogate visual neurophysiology in PwPP as part of the Psychosis Human Connectome Project (HCP). In addition to PwPP (n = 66) and healthy controls (n = 43), we also recruited first-degree biological relatives (n = 44) in order to examine the role of genetic liability for psychosis in visual perception. Our visual tasks were designed to assess fundamental visual processes in PwPP, whereas MR spectroscopy enabled us to examine neurochemistry, including excitatory and inhibitory markers. We show that it is feasible to collect high-quality data across multiple psychophysical, functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy experiments with a sizable number of participants at a single research site. These data, in addition to those from our previously described 3 tesla experiments, will be made publicly available in order to facilitate further investigations by other research groups. By combining visual neuroscience techniques and HCP brain imaging methods, our experiments offer new opportunities to investigate the neural basis of abnormal visual perception in PwPP.

AB  - Visual illusions are a gateway to understand how we construct our experience of reality. Unfortunately, important questions remain open, such as the hypothesis of a common factor underlying the sensitivity to different types of illusions, as well as of personality correlates of illusion sensitivity. In this study, we used a novel parametric framework for visual illusions to generate 10 different classic illusions (Delboeuf, Ebbinghaus, Rod and Frame, Vertical-Horizontal, Zollner, White, Muller-Lyer, Ponzo, Poggendorff, Contrast) varying in strength, embedded in a perceptual discrimination task. We tested the objective effect of the illusions on errors and response times, and extracted participant-level performance scores (n=250) for each illusion. Our results provide evidence in favour of a general factor underlying the sensitivity to different illusions (labelled Factor i). Moreover, we report a positive link between illusion sensitivity and personality traits such as Agreeableness, Honesty-Humility, and negative relationships with Psychoticism, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Negative Affect.

AB  - Background and objectives: A disruption in the co-ordination of bottom-up and top-down processing is thought to underlie anomalous perceptual experiences in psychosis. Visual illusions represent a valuable methodology in exploring this disruption. Here, we examined visual illusions in a group of young people having psychotic-like experiences. We also examined the relationship between illusion susceptibility and appraisal of psychotic-like experiences as well as depression, anxiety and stress levels. Method: 25 young people reporting psychotic-like experiences and 53 healthy participants performed an adjustment task that measured susceptibility to a battery of 13 visual illusions. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress were quantified in both groups. The clinical group also completed measures examining frequency, appraisals and emotional responses to psychotic-like experiences. Results: A general increase of illusion susceptibility was found in the clinical group compared to the control group. However, when depression, anxiety and stress levels were controlled for, this difference disappeared. Stress turned out to be the best predictor of illusion susceptibility in the clinical group, whereas anomalous experiences, depression and anxiety were unrelated to overall illusion strength. Limitations: This study is limited to young participants reporting significant mental health difficulties and psychotic-like experiences. Findings should be replicated in an Ultra High Risk (prodromal) group. Conclusions: Increased levels of stress explained the enhanced vulnerability to illusions in the clinical group. This increased susceptibility suggests a perceptual style that relies too heavily on prior expectations at the expense of the true sensory evidence, potentially leading to an altered perceptual experience of the world.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by pervasive deficits in cognitive functioning. However, few well-powered studies have examined the degree to which cognitive performance is impaired even among individuals with schizophrenia not currently on antipsychotic medications using a wide range of cognitive and reinforcement learning measures derived from cognitive neuroscience. Such research is particularly needed in the domain of reinforcement learning, given the central role of dopamine in reinforcement learning, and the potential impact of antipsychotic medications on dopamine function. Methods: The present study sought to fill this gap by examining healthy controls (N = 75), unmedicated (N = 48) and medicated (N = 148) individuals with schizophrenia. Participants were recruited across five sites as part of the CNTRaCS Consortium to complete tasks assessing processing speed, cognitive control, working memory, verbal learning, relational encoding and retrieval, visual integration and reinforcement learning. Results: Individuals with schizophrenia who were not taking antipsychotic medications, as well as those taking antipsychotic medications, showed pervasive deficits across cognitive domains including reinforcement learning, processing speed, cognitive control, working memory, verbal learning and relational encoding and retrieval. Further, we found that chlorpromazine equivalency rates were significantly related to processing speed and working memory, while there were no significant relationships between anticholinergic load and performance on other tasks. Conclusions: These findings add to a body of literature suggesting that cognitive deficits are an enduring aspect of schizophrenia, present in those off antipsychotic medications as well as those taking antipsychotic medications.

AB  - Visual illusions have long been used as tools to investigate sensory-perceptual deficits in schizophrenia. Recent conflicting accounts have called into question the assumption of abnormal illusion perception in patients and, therefore, the validity of this approach. Here, we present a systematic review of the current evidence regarding visual illusion perception abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia. Relevant publications were identified by a systematic search of PubMed, Literatura LILACS, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), IBECS, BIOSIS, and Web of Science. Forty-five studies were selected which included illusions classified as 'Motion illusions', 'Geometric-optical illusions', 'Illusory contours', 'Depth inversion illusion', and 'Non-specific'. There is concordant evidence of abnormal processing of illusions in patients for most categories, especially in facial Depth Inversion and Muller-Lyer illusions. There were significant methodological disparities and shortcomings, but risk of bias was overall low for individual studies. The usefulness of visual illusions as tools in clinical settings as well as in basic research may be contingent on significant methodological refinements.

AB  - Visual shape completion is a canonical perceptual organization process that integrates spatially distributed edge information into unified representations of objects. People with schizophrenia show difficulty in discriminating completed shapes, but the brain networks and functional connections underlying this perceptual difference remain poorly understood. Also unclear is whether brain network differences in schizophrenia occur in related illnesses or vary with illness features transdiagnostically. To address these topics, we scanned (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or no psychiatric illness during rest and during a task in which they discriminated configurations that formed or failed to form completed shapes (illusory and fragmented condition, respectively). Multivariate pattern differences were identified on the cortical surface using 360 predefined parcels and 12 functional networks composed of such parcels. Brain activity flow mapping was used to evaluate the likely involvement of resting-state connections for shape completion. Illusory/fragmented task activation differences ('modulations') in the dorsal attention network (DAN) could distinguish people with schizophrenia from the other groups (AUCs > .85) and could transdiagnostically predict cognitive disorganization severity. Activity flow over functional connections from the DAN could predict secondary visual network modulations in each group, except in schizophrenia. The secondary visual network was strongly and similarly modulated in each group. Task modulations were dispersed over more networks in patients compared to controls. In summary, DAN activity during visual perceptual organization is distinct in schizophrenia, symptomatically relevant, and potentially related to improper attention-related feedback into secondary visual areas.

AB  - Perceptual disorders are not part of the diagnosis criteria for schizophrenia. Yet, a considerable amount of work has been conducted, especially on visual perception abnormalities, and there is little doubt that visual perception is altered in patients. There are several reasons why such perturbations are of interest in this pathology. They are observed during the prodromal phase of psychosis, they are related to the pathophysiology (clinical disorganization, disorders of the sense of self), and they are associated with neuronal connectivity disorders. Perturbations occur at different levels of processing and likely affect how patients interact and adapt to their surroundings. The literature has become very large, and here we try to summarize different models that have guided the exploration of perception in patients. We also illustrate several lines of research by showing how perception has been investigated and by discussing the interpretation of the results. In addition to discussing domains such as contrast sensitivity, masking, and visual grouping, we develop more recent fields like processing at the level of the retina, and the timing of perception.

AB  - The findings on the association of schizotypal traits with the perception of visual illusions are scarce and inconsistent and have not taken into consideration potential effects of childhood traumatic experiences, a risk factor for schizophrenia-spectrum conditions. Thus, the present study addressed the question of potential moderating effects of early traumatic experiences on the association between different aspects of schizotypal traits with the perception of the Muller-Lyer and Navon's Hierarchical Letters (NHL) illusions. The study revealed that (a) increased suspiciousness was associated with increased liability to the Muller-Lyer illusion, when the exposure to traumatic events was high, whereas the opposite pattern was true when the exposure to traumatic events was low; (b) negative schizotypy was associated with more accurate global perception, and high disorganized schizotypy was associated with superior accuracy when target letters were present during the NHL illusion, when early traumatic experiences were at lower levels; and (c) high negative, disorganized, and total schizotypy were associated with lower accuracy when target letters were present in the NHL paradigm, when early traumatic experiences were at higher levels. The findings of the study suggest that early traumatic events differentially moderate the relationship between various aspects of schizotypal traits and visual perceptual processing.

AB  - Antagonistic interactions between center and surround receptive field (RF) components lie at the heart of the computations performed in the visual system. Circularly symmetric center-surround RFs are thought to enhance responses to spatial contrasts (i.e., edges), but how visual edges affect motion processing is unclear. Here, we addressed this question in retinal bipolar cells, the first visual neuron with classic center-surround interactions. We found that bipolar glutamate release emphasizes objects that emerge in the RF; their responses to continuous motion are smaller, slower, and cannot be predicted by signals elicited by stationary stimuli. In our hands, the alteration in signal dynamics induced by novel objects was more pronounced than edge enhancement and could be explained by priming of RF surround during continuous motion. These findings echo the salience of human visual perception and demonstrate an unappreciated capacity of the center-surround architecture to facilitate novel object detection and dynamic signal representation.

AB  - The field of psychiatry is far from perfect in predicting which individuals will transition to a psychotic disorder. Here, we argue that visual system assessment can help in this regard. Such assessments have generated medium-to-large group differences with individuals prior to or near the first psychotic episode or have shown little influence of illness duration in larger samples of more chronic patients. For example, self-reported visual perceptual distortions-so-called visual basic symptoms-occur in up to 2/3rds of those with non-affective psychosis and have already longitudinally predicted an impending onset of schizophrenia. Possibly predictive psychophysical markers include enhanced contrast sensitivity, prolonged backward masking, muted collinear facilitation, reduced stereoscopic depth perception, impaired contour and shape integration, and spatially restricted exploratory eye movements. Promising brain-based markers include visual thalamo-cortical hyperconnectivity, decreased occipital gamma band power during visual detection (MEG), and reduced visually evoked occipital P1 amplitudes (EEG). Potentially predictive retinal markers include diminished cone a- and b-wave amplitudes and an attenuated photopic flicker response during electroretinography. The foregoing assessments are often well-described mechanistically, implying that their findings could readily shed light on the underlying pathophysiological changes that precede or accompany a transition to psychosis. The retinal and psychophysical assessments in particular are inexpensive, well-tolerated, easy to administer, and brief, with few inclusion/exclusion criteria. Therefore, across all major levels of analysis-from phenomenology to behavior to brain and retinal functioning-visual system assessment could complement and improve upon existing methods for predicting which individuals go on to develop a psychotic disorder.

AB  - Here we investigate how the extent of spatial attention affects center-surround interaction in visual motion processing. To do so, we measured motion direction discrimination thresholds in humans using drifting gratings and two attention conditions. Participants were instructed to limit their attention to the central part of the stimulus under the narrow attention condition, and to both central and surround parts under the wide attention condition. We found stronger surround suppression under the wide attention condition. The magnitude of the attention effect increased with the size of the surround when the stimulus had low contrast, but did not change when it had high contrast. Results also showed that attention had a weaker effect when the center and surround gratings drifted in opposite directions. Next, to establish a link between the behavioral results and the neuronal response characteristics, we performed computer simulations using the divisive normalization model. Our simulations showed that using smaller versus larger multiplicative attentional gain and parameters derived from the medial temporal (MT) area of the cortex, the model can successfully predict the observed behavioral results. These findings reveal the critical role of spatial attention on surround suppression and establish a link between neuronal activity and behavior. Further, these results also suggest that the reduced surround suppression found in certain clinical disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) may be caused by abnormal attention mechanisms.

AB  - Examined the shape completion abilities of patients with bipolar disorder. The sample comprised 23 healthy controls, 23 schizophrenia patients (including 3 with schizoaffective disorder), and 26 patients who had type I, type II, or not otherwise specified variants of bipolar disorder. Consistent with prior studies, "shape completion" was defined as the illusory/fragmented threshold difference in the absence of distractors. Results show that shape completion deficits are large in schizophrenia, diminish in severity from schizophrenia to bipolar disorder to no disorder, and can be revealed with fewer than 40 test trials. Shape completion deficits thus constitute a potentially useful biobehavioral marker for schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Minor hallucinations (MH) are psychotic symptoms that can occur anywhere between prodromal to early Parkinson's disease and after onset of motor problems. MH include visual illusions, presence hallucinations, and passage hallucinations. Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a harbinger of neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the clinical characteristics of isolated RBD with MH and the risk of phenoconversion. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 36 patients with isolated RBD (four females; median age, 75.0 years). We defined cases reporting at least one minor hallucination as RBD with MH. Demographic data and cognitive function were compared between patients with and without MH, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated the risk of phenoconversion. Result(s): We included 10 (27.8%) patients with MH and 26 (72.2%) without MH. Patients with MH were older, had less dopamine transporter accumulation, more severe autonomic dysfunction, more depressive symptoms, and lower verbal fluency and symbol coding test scores than patients without MH. After follow-up (median, 2.50 years), 13.9% (5/36) of all patients developed phenoconversion (Parkinson's disease, two patients; dementia with Lewy bodies, three patients). The rate of phenoconversion was significantly higher in patients with MH (40.0% vs. 3.8%, p =.005). The Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration revealed that MH was a significant risk factor for phenoconversion (hazard ratio, 14.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-160.5). Conclusion(s): Minor hallucinations may be utilized as early clinical markers for prodromal estimation of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Visual illusions (VI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally considered as an early feature of the psychosis spectrum leading to fully formed visual hallucinations (VH), although this sequential relationship has not been clearly demonstrated. Objective(s): We aimed to determine whether there are any overlapping, potentially graded patterns of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in PD with VI and with VH. Such a finding would argue for a continuum between these entities, whereas distinct imaging features would suggest different neural underpinnings for the phenomena. Method(s): In this case control study, we compared structural and resting state functional MRI brain patterns of PD patients with VH (PD-H, n = 20), with VI (PD-I, n = 19), and without VH or VI (PD-C, n = 23). Result(s): 1) PD-H had hypo-connectivity between the ILO and anterior cingulate precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-I; 2) In contrast, PD-I had hyper-connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and the postcentral gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-H. Moreover, PD-I had higher levels of functional connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and fronto-temporal regions compared to PD-H, together with divergent patterns toward the cingulate. 3) Both PD-I and PD-H had functional hypo-connectivity between the lingual gyrus and the parahippocampal region vs. PD-C, and no significant grey matter volume differences was observed between PD-I and PD-H. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of functional connectivity characterized VI and VH in PD, suggesting that these two perceptual experiences, while probably linked and driven by at least some similar mechanisms, could reflect differing neural dysfunction.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - Visual illusions are fascinating phenomena that have been used and studied by artists and scientists for centuries, leading to important discoveries about the neurocognitive underpinnings of perception, consciousness, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Surprisingly, despite their historical and theoretical importance as psychological stimuli, there is no dedicated software, nor consistent approach, to generate illusions in a systematic fashion. Instead, scientists have to craft them by hand in an idiosyncratic fashion, or use pre-made images not tailored for the specific needs of their studies. This, in turn, hinders the reproducibility of illusion-based research, narrowing possibilities for scientific breakthroughs and their applications. With the aim of addressing this gap, Pyllusion is a Python-based open-source software (freely available at https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion), that offers a framework to manipulate and generate illusions in a systematic way, compatible with different output formats such as image files (.png, .jpg, .tiff, etc.) or experimental software (such as PsychoPy).

AB  - Background: Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in visual contrast processing, though less is known about how these deficits impact neurocognition and functional outcomes. This study investigated effects of contrast sensitivity (CS) on cognition and capacity for independent living in schizophrenia. Methods: Participants were 58 patients with schizophrenia (n = 49) and schizoaffective disorder (n = 9). Patients completed a psychophysical paradigm to obtain CS with stimuli consisting of grating patterns of low (0.5 and 1 cycles/degree) and high spatial frequencies (4, 7, 21 cycles/degree). Patients completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, Third Edition to assess cognition, and the problem-solving factor of the Independent Living Scales to assess functional capacity. We computed bivariate correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables and tested mediation models with CS to low (CS-LSF) and high spatial frequencies (CS-HSF) as predictors, cognitive measures as mediators, and capacity for independent living as an outcome. Results: Cognition mediated the relationship between CS and independent living with CS-LSF a stronger predictor than CS-HSF. Mediation effects were strongest for perceptual organization and memory-related domains. In an expanded moderated mediation model, CS-HSF was found to be a significant predictor of independent living through perceptual organization as a mediator and CS-LSF as a moderator of this relationship. Conclusion: CS relates to functional capacity in schizophrenia through neurocognition. These relationships may inform novel visual remediation interventions.

AB  - Until the beginning of the twentieth century, neurologists considered that mental disorders in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) occurred in the terminal phases of the disease or were due to coincidental pathologies. Benjamin Ball (1834-1893), in 1881 and 1882, drew attention to the frequency of cognitive and depressive disorders in PD. In 1883, Victor Parant (1848-1924), referring to Ball's work, published the first detailed observation of a PD patient with dementia and psychotic symptoms. Parant was an alienist running a private clinic for mental diseases in Toulouse, France. One of his main interests was the question of the responsibility of the insane, and he was called upon as a forensic expert in several cases. In this context, Parant examined a man who had been suffering from PD for several years, and later developed concurrently severe cognitive impairment and psychotic disorders. The patient would meet modern criteria for PD-associated psychosis: he had multimodal hallucinations (visual, auditory and somatic), visual illusions, and paranoid delusions. He also reported unusual symptoms: supernumerary limbs and Alice in Wonderland syndrome. Parant forwarded the far-sighted hypothesis that cognitive and psychotic disorders were due to the extension of PD lesions within the brain. The unheralded work of Victor Parant should be recognized in the history of neuropsychiatry. Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visual cognition is finely tuned to the elements in a scene but also relies on contextual integration to improve visual detection and discrimination. This integration is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Studying impairments in contextual integration may lead to biomarkers of schizophrenia, tools to monitor disease progression, and, in animal models, insight into the underlying neural deficits. We developed a nonhuman primate model to test the hypothesis that hypofunction of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) impairs contextual integration. Two male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were trained to indicate which of two patterns on the screen had the highest contrast. One of these patterns appeared in isolation, and the other was surrounded by a high-contrast pattern. In humans, this high-contrast context is known to lead to an underestimation of contrast. This so-called Chubb illusion is thought to result from surround suppression, a key contextual integration mechanism. To test the involvement of NMDAR in this process, we compared animals' perceptual bias with and without intramuscular injections of a subanesthetic dose of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. In the absence of ketamine, the animals reported a Chubb illusion - matching reports in healthy humans. Hence, monkeys - just like humans - perform visual contextual integration. This reaffirms the importance of nonhuman primates to help understand visual cognition. Injection of ketamine significantly reduced the strength of the illusion and thus impaired contextual integration. This supports the hypothesis that NMDAR hypofunction plays a causal role in specific behavioral impairments observed in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Psychotic symptoms are an important and increasingly recognized aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They have been shown to contribute to faster disease progression in clinic-based, demographically homogenous samples with high educational attainment. Objective:We studied the association between baseline psychotic symptoms and disease progression among individuals with incident AD or 'at risk' of developing AD, from a demographically heterogenous, community-based cohort with minimal educational attainment. Methods: 212 participants received the Columbia University Scale of Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease scale. Participants had psychotic symptoms with any of: visual illusions, delusions, hallucinations, or agitation/aggression. Disease progression was measured yearly and defined by meeting cognitive (<=10 on the Folstein MMSE) or functional endpoints (>=10 on the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale or >=4 on the Dependence Scale). Results: The mean age was 85 years old. The cohort was 78.3% female, 75.9% Hispanic, and had a mean 6.96 years of education. Within the follow-up period (mean: 3.69 years), 24 met the cognitive endpoint, 59 met the functional endpoint, and 132 met the cutoff for dependence. The presence of at least one psychotic symptom was initially associated with an increased risk of reaching the functional endpoint (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.67-5.86, p < 0.001) and the endpoint of dependence (HR = 1.498, 95% CI 1.05-2.13, p = 0.03). However, these associations were attenuated and non-significant when adjusted for baseline functional status. Psychotic symptoms were not associated with the cognitive endpoint. Conclusion: Psychotic symptoms may predict functional decline in patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity and with lower educational attainment.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that processing of visual contrast information could be altered in major depressive disorder. To clarify the changes at different levels of the visual hierarchy, we behaviourally measured contrast perception in 2 centre-surround conditions, assessing retinal and cortical processing. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study, our sample consisted of controls (n = 29; 21 female) and patients with unipolar depression, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder who had baseline major depressive episodes (n = 111; 74 female). In a brightness induction test that assessed retinal processing, participants compared the perceived luminance of uniform patches (presented on a computer screen) as the luminance of the backgrounds was varied. In a contrast suppression test that assessed cortical processing, participants compared the perceived contrast of gratings, which were presented with collinearly or orthogonally oriented backgrounds. Results: Brightness induction was similar for patients with major depressive episodes and controls (p = 0.60, d = 0.115, Bayes factor = 3.9), but contrast suppression was significantly lower for patients than for controls (p < 0.006, d = 0.663, Bayes factor = 35.2). We observed no statistically significant associations between contrast suppression and age, sex, or medication or diagnostic subgroup. At follow-up (n = 74), we observed some normalization of contrast perception. Limitations: We assessed contrast perception using behavioural tests instead of electrophysiology. Conclusion: The reduced contrast suppression we observed may have been caused by decreased retinal feedforward or cortical feedback signals. Because we observed intact brightness induction, our results suggest normal retinal but altered cortical processing of visual contrast during a major depressive episode. This alteration is likely to be present in multiple types of depression and to partially normalize upon remission. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to examine the cognitive performance of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) stratified by illness phase compared to that of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. Methods: Participants were 139 patients with BD (55 euthymic and 84 depressed), 311 patients with MDD (88 euthymic and 223 depressed), and 386 healthy controls who underwent the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised or the Third Edition. They were non-elderly Japanese individuals with normal estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ; >90), group-matched for age, sex, and premorbid IQ. Results: The depressed BD group showed significantly lower scores on verbal IQ, performance IQ, full-scale IQ, and three group indexes of perceptual organization, working memory, and processing speed when compared with healthy controls (all P < 0.001). All IQs and working memory index were also significantly lower than those of the depressed MDD group. The depressed MDD group scored significantly lower than controls in performance IQ (P < 0.001), full-scale IQ, and only in the index of processing speed (P < 0.001). The euthymic BD group scored significantly lower than controls in performance IQ (P = 0.004), whereas the euthymic MDD group scored significantly lower than controls only in processing speed (P = 0.030). Conclusion: Patients with BD appear to have global and more intense cognitive impairments in depressed states compared with those with MDD whose impairments seem to be apparent only in processing speed in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Attenuated impairments appear to exist in euthymic states of both patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Minor hallucinations (MHs), including sense of presence, passage hallucinations, and visual illusions, have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the prevalence and associated risk factors for MHs according to appearance time. Method(s): Data on the clinical characteristics and the appearance time of MHs for 100 PD patients were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed. MHs were classified into two groups according to the time when MHs appeared: MHs appearing while awake during the daytime (dMHs) and MHs appearing at arousal from sleep during the night or early morning (aMHs). Result(s): Thirty-eight patients (38%) experienced MHs. dMHs and aMHs were present in 21 (21%) and 28 patients (28%), respectively. Compared to patients without MHs, patients with dMHs had more severe motor symptoms, longer disease duration, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), and higher rates of cognitive impairment and visual hallucinations during the daytime, whereas patients with aMHs had a higher rate of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), longer disease duration, higher LEDD, and higher dopamine agonist dosage. Logistic regression analysis showed that cognitive impairment was significantly associated with dMHs (odds ratio (OR) 7.292, p =.001), and that RBD (OR 8.306, p <.001) and LEDD (OR 1.002, p =.049) were significantly associated with aMHs. Conclusion(s): Patients with MHs have different clinical characteristics according to the time when MHs appear. These findings have important clinical and prognostic implications and suggest appropriate therapeutic options for psychotic symptoms.Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Individual differences in perception are widespread. Considering inter-individual variability, synesthetes experience stable additional sensations; schizophrenia patients suffer perceptual deficits in, eg, perceptual organization (alongside hallucinations and delusions). Is there a unifying principle explaining inter-individual variability in perception? There is good reason to believe perceptual experience results from inferential processes whereby sensory evidence is weighted by prior knowledge about the world. Perceptual variability may result from different precision weighting of sensory evidence and prior knowledge. We tested this hypothesis by comparing visibility thresholds in a perceptual hysteresis task across medicated schizophrenia patients (N = 20), synesthetes (N = 20), and controls (N = 26). Participants rated the subjective visibility of stimuli embedded in noise while we parametrically manipulated the availability of sensory evidence. Additionally, precise long-term priors in synesthetes were leveraged by presenting either synesthesia-inducing or neutral stimuli. Schizophrenia patients showed increased visibility thresholds, consistent with overreliance on sensory evidence. In contrast, synesthetes exhibited lowered thresholds exclusively for synesthesia-inducing stimuli suggesting high-precision long-term priors. Additionally, in both synesthetes and schizophrenia patients explicit, short-term priors-introduced during the hysteresis experiment-lowered thresholds but did not normalize perception. Our results imply that perceptual variability might result from differences in the precision afforded to prior beliefs and sensory evidence, respectively.

AB  - Background: Accurate perception of visual contours is essential for seeing and differentiating objects in the environment. Both the ability to detect visual contours and the influence of perceptual context created by surrounding stimuli are diminished in people with schizophrenia (SCZ). The central aim of the present study was to better understand the biological underpinnings of impaired contour integration and weakened effects of perceptual context. Additionally, we sought to determine whether visual perceptual abnormalities reflect genetic factors in SCZ and are present in other severe mental disorders. Methods: We examined behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs) collected during the perception of simple linear contours embedded in similar background stimuli in 27 patients with SCZ, 23 patients with bipolar disorder (BP), 23 first-degree relatives of SCZ, and 37 controls. Results: SCZ exhibited impaired visual contour detection while BP exhibited intermediate performance. The orientation of neighboring stimuli (i.e. flankers) relative to the contour modulated perception across all groups, but SCZ exhibited weakened suppression by the perceptual context created by flankers. Late visual (occipital P2) and cognitive (centroparietal P3) neural responses showed group differences and flanker orientation effects, unlike earlier ERPs (occipital P1 and N1). Moreover, behavioral effects of flanker context on contour perception were correlated with modulation in P2 & P3 amplitudes. Conclusion: In addition to replicating and extending findings of abnormal contour integration and visual context modulation in SCZ, we provide novel evidence that the abnormal use of perceptual context is associated with higher-order sensory and cognitive processes.

AB  - Two main subcortical pathways serving conscious visual perception are the midget-parvocellular (P), and the parasol-magnocellular (M) pathways. It is generally accepted that the P pathway serves red-green color vision, but the relative contribution of P and M pathways to spatial vision is a long-standing and unresolved issue. Here, we mapped the spatial sampling properties of P and M pathways across the human retina. Data were obtained from immunolabeled vertical sections of six postmortem male and female human donor retinas and imaged using high-resolution microscopy. Cone photoreceptors, OFF-midget bipolar cells (P pathway), OFF-diffuse bipolar (DB) types DB3a and DB3b (M pathway), and ganglion cells were counted along the temporal horizontal meridian, taking foveal spatial distortions (postreceptoral displacements) into account. We found that the density of OFF-midget bipolar and OFF-midget ganglion cells can support one-to-one connections to 1.05-mm (3.6degree) eccentricity. One-to-one connections of cones to OFF-midget bipolar cells are present to at least 10-mm (35degree) eccentricity. The OFF-midget ganglion cell array acuity is well-matched to photopic spatial acuity measures throughout the central 35degree, but the OFF-parasol array acuity is well below photopic spatial acuity, supporting the view that the P pathway underlies high-acuity spatial vision. Outside the fovea, array acuity of both OFF-midget and OFF-DB cells exceeds psychophysical measures of photopic spatial acuity. We conclude that parasol and midget pathway bipolar cells deliver high-acuity spatial signals to the inner plexiform layer, but outside the fovea, this spatial resolution is lost at the level of ganglion cells. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We make accurate maps of the spatial density and distribution of neurons in the human retina to aid in understanding human spatial vision, interpretation of diagnostic tests, and the implementation of therapies for retinal diseases. Here, we map neurons involved with the midget-parvocellular (P pathway) and parasol-magnocellular (M pathway) through human retina. We find that P-type bipolar cells outnumber M-type bipolar cells at all eccentricities. We show that cone photoreceptors and P-type pathway bipolar cells are tightly connected throughout the retina, but that spatial resolution is lost at the level of the ganglion cells. Overall, the results support the view that the P pathway is specialized to serve both high acuity vision and red-green color vision. Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 the authors.

AB  - The underpinnings of poor decision-making in schizophrenia could reflect excessively risky or inhibited behaviors. This study employed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to compare decision-making in schizophrenia cases to that of healthy controls. Individuals with schizophrenia performed significantly differently across three trials, failing to improve their performance as shown by the control group. In the control group, cognitive ability, measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) showed that Perceptual Organization scores predicted Average Inflations per Trial, Total Balloon Pops, and Total Earnings. Although the schizophrenia cases failed to learn, group performance on the BART was not associated with cognitive ability, but regression analyses showed 41.4% of average inflations per trial were explained by Excitement, Delusions, Emotional Withdrawal, and Poor Rapport; total balloon pops were only explained by emotional withdrawal and Total Earnings were reduced by Delusions, Excitement and Poor Rapport. Only healthy participants demonstrated a relation between cognitive ability performance improvement across trials. Schizophrenia cases showed less risk-taking, and earned significantly less money overall. Identifying the determinants of poor decision-making could inform interventions and possible treatments to improve their function and perhaps be of relevance to public safety if decisions are overly risky.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia (ScZ) often show impairments in auditory information processing. These impairments have been related to clinical symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations. Some researchers have hypothesized that aberrant low-frequency oscillations contribute to auditory information processing deficits in ScZ. A paradigm for which modulations in low-frequency oscillations are consistently found in healthy individuals is the auditory continuity illusion (ACI), in which restoration processes lead to a perceptual grouping of tone fragments and a mask, so that a physically interrupted sound is perceived as continuous. We used the ACI paradigm to test the hypothesis that low-frequency oscillations play a role in aberrant auditory information processing in patients with ScZ (N = 23). Compared with healthy control participants we found that patients with ScZ show elevated continuity illusions of interrupted, partially-masked tones. Electroencephalography data demonstrate that this elevated continuity perception is reflected by diminished 3 Hz power. This suggests that reduced low-frequency oscillations relate to elevated restoration processes in ScZ. Our findings support the hypothesis that aberrant low-frequency oscillations contribute to altered perception-related auditory information processing in ScZ.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder associated with cognitive dysfunction and changes in primary sensory processing. This article aims to explore the current insights into the relationship between schizophrenia and different visual disturbances. Method(s): To provide a literature review of visual impairments in schizophrenia, we performed a PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus search to identify all articles in English on the topic up to the end of 2018. Result(s): Multiple retinal functional and structural abnormalities are found in patients with schizophrenia. Wider retinal venules suggest chronically insufficient brain supply of oxygen and this could contribute to the occurrence of psychotic symptoms. Optical coherence tomography studies showed that retinal nerve fiber layer, macular thickness, and macular volume were significantly lowered in the chronic phase of schizophrenia. Results from electroretinogram recordings have demonstrated different declinations such as abnormalities of a - wave activity in the photoreceptors or b - wave activity in the bipolar and Muller cells. Abnormalities in eye movements, such as a notable decrease in saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements, are one of the most reliable and reproducible impairments associated with schizophrenia. Disrupted visual processing of the magnocellular pathway may result in a decrease of contrast sensitivity, sensory processing, orientation discrimination, visual integration, trajectory and spatial localization, backward masking and motion tracking. Visual perceptual abnormalities occur in more than 60% of schizophrenic patients and these are visual hallucinations, perceptual distortion of colors, shapes and light intensity, decrease in contour integration and surround suppression. Other, frequently present eye disorders include impaired visual acuity, strabismus and nystagmus. Conclusion(s): Visual impairments are one of the most important features of schizophrenia, which could help in defining the disease state and assigning appropriate treatment.Copyright <c2><a9> Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia

AB  - The limited dynamic range of regular screens restricts the display of high dynamic range (HDR) images. Inspired by retinal processing mechanisms, we propose a tone mapping method to address this problem. In the retina, horizontal cells (HCs) adaptively adjust their receptive field (RF) size based on the local stimuli to regulate the visual signals absorbed by photoreceptors. Using this adaptive mechanism, the proposed method compresses the dynamic range locally in different regions, and has the capability of avoiding halo artifacts around the edges of high luminance contrast. Moreover, the proposed method introduces the center-surround antagonistic RF structure of bipolar cells (BCs) to enhance the local contrast and details. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method performs robustly well on a wide variety of images, providing competitive results against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual inspection, objective metrics and observer scores.

AB  - Although meta-analyses suggest that schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with a more severe neurocognitive phenotype than mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, considerable between-subject heterogeneity exists in the phenotypic presentation of these deficits across mental illnesses. Indeed, it is unclear whether the processes that underlie cognitive dysfunction in these disorders are unique to each disease or represent a common neurobiological process that varies in severity. Here we used latent profile analysis (LPA) across 3 distinct cognitive domains (cognitive control, episodic memory, and visual integration; using data from the CNTRACS consortium) to identify distinct profiles of patients across psychotic illnesses. LPA was performed on a sample of 223 psychosis patients (59 with Type I bipolar disorder, 88 with SZ, and 76 with schizoaffective disorder). Seventy-three healthy control participants were included for comparison but were not included in sample LPA. Three latent profiles ("Low," "Moderate," and "High" ability) were identified as the underlying covariance across the 3 domains. The 3-profile solution provided highly similar fit to a single continuous factor extracted by confirmatory factor analysis, supporting a unidimensional structure. Diagnostic ratios did not significantly differ between profiles, suggesting that these profiles cross diagnostic boundaries (an exception being the Low ability profile, which had only one bipolar patient). Profile membership predicted Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale symptom severity as well as everyday communication skills independent of diagnosis. Biological, clinical and methodological implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Faces convey valuable daily life social signals. As in most psychiatric conditions, non-verbal social cognition or its components including face processing may be aberrant in schizophrenia (SZ). Social participation of individuals with SZ is vital for their quality of life, and remediation of social abilities in this population is of high relevance both for society and clinical care. Method: Tuning to faces in non-face images such as shadows, grilled toasts, or ink blots is called face pareidolia. Humans possess high sensitivity to facial signals: even fetuses and infants are well tuned to coarse face cues. Here we assessed face tuning in individuals with SZ and person-by-person matched controls by using a new experimental tool, a set of food-plate images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Results and conclusions: The outcome indicates that individuals with SZ exhibit aberrant face tuning in face-like non-face images (chi2(1) = 17.44, p = 0.0001) that can hamper adaptive interaction with peers and social participation hindering, in turn, clinical remediation. Face response rate in SZ patients was related to the scores on the event arrangement task tapping social cognition (Pearson product-moment correlation, r = 0.602, p = 0.01) and on picture completion task assessing visual perceptual organization (Spearman's rho = 0.614, p = 0.009). Therefore, poor performance on the face tuning task is unlikely to be accounted for by deviant general cognitive abilities, but rather by impairments in perceptual integration and social cognition. Comparison of these findings with data in autism and other neuropsychiatric conditions provides novel insights on the origins of face tuning in SZ and triggers brain imaging research.

AB  - Integrating visual and auditory information during gesture-speech integration (GSI) is important for successful social communication, which is often impaired in schizophrenia. Several studies suggested the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) to be a relevant multisensory integration site. However, intact STS activation patterns were often reported in patients. Thus, here we used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to analyze whether information processing in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) is impaired during GSI on network level. We investigated GSI in three different samples. First, we replicated a recently published connectivity model for GSI in a healthy subject group (n = 19). Second, we investigated differences between patients with SSD and a matched healthy control group (n = 17 each). Participants were presented videos of an actor performing intrinsically meaningful gestures accompanied by spoken sentences in German or Russian, or just telling a German sentence without gestures. Across all groups, fMRI analyses revealed similar activation patterns, and DCM analyses resulted in the same winning model for GSI. This finding directly replicates previous results. However, patients revealed significantly reduced connectivity in the verbal pathway (from left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) to left STS). The clinical significance of this connection is supported by its correlations with the severity of concretism and a subscale of negative symptoms (SANS). Our model confirms the importance of the pSTS as integration site during audio-visual integration. Patients showed generally intact connectivity during GSI, but revealed impaired information transfer via the verbal pathway. This might be the basis of interpersonal communication problems in patients with SSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Long-range horizontal connections in early vision undergird a well-studied "collinear facilitation" effect, wherein a central low-contrast target becomes more detectable when flanked by collinear elements. Collinear facilitation is weaker in schizophrenia. Might lateral connections be responsible? To consider the possibility, we had 38 schizophrenia patients and 49 well-matched healthy controls judge the presence of a central low-contrast element flanked by collinear or orthogonal high-contrast elements. The display (target+flankers) was scaled in size to produce a lower and higher spatial frequency ("SF") condition (4 and 10 cycles/deg, respectively). Larger stimulus arrays bias processing towards feedback connections from higher-order visual areas; smaller arrays bias processing toward lateral connections. Patients had impaired facilitation relative to controls at higher but not lower SFs. Combining data from a past study on "contour integration" (in which subjects sought to detect chains of co-circular elements), we found correlated integration and facilitation performance at the higher SF and a similar effect of spatial scaling across SF, suggesting a common mechanism. In an exploratory analysis, worse contrast thresholds (without facilitation) correlated strongly with more premorbid dysfunction. In schizophrenia, inter-element filling-in worsens at smaller spatial scales potentially because of its increased reliance on impaired lateral connections in early vision.

AB  - Hallucinations have been found to be associated with various types of source memory failure in both schizophrenia patients and hallucination-prone healthy individuals. We investigated the associations of clinical and non-clinical hallucinations with source memory errors in a visual memory task that involved the remembering of picture presentation context. 59 schizophrenia patients and 61 healthy individuals took part in the study. Pictures were presented either at different locations or in association with different visual stimuli. The participants were required afterwards to recognize the target pictures among distractors, and then to remember their spatial location or the visual stimulus that was associated with them. Liberal response bias in picture recognition was associated with hallucination proneness and auditory-verbal hallucinations in subsamples of participants with significant non-clinical or clinical hallucinations. After controlling for overall memory performance, failure to remember the spatial location of the pictures was associated with visual hallucinations in male patients; failure to remember the associated visual stimulus was related to auditory-verbal hallucinations in female patients and to hallucination proneness in healthy women. The findings suggest that both clinical and non-clinical hallucinations are associated with loss of contextual information relative to the acquisition of events.

AB  - Contour integration, a key visual function to deal with occlusion and discontinuity in natural scenes, is essential to human survival. However, individuals are not equally well equipped with this ability. In particular, contour integration deficiencies are commonly detected in patients with mental disorders, especially schizophrenia. To understand the underlying sources of these individual differences, the current study investigated the genetic basis of contour integration in humans. A total of 2619 normal participants were tested on their ability to detect continuous contours embedded in a cluttered background. Quantitative genomic analysis was performed, involving heritability estimation based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and association testing at SNP, gene, and pathway levels. Heritability estimation showed that common SNPs contributed 49.5% (standard error of the mean = 15.6%) of overall phenotypic variation, indicating moderate heritability of contour integration. Two-stage genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) detected four SNPs reaching genome-wide significance in the discovery test (N = 1931) but not passing the replication test (N = 688). Gene-level analysis further revealed a significant genome-wide association of a microRNA-encoding gene MIR1178 in both the discovery and replication cohorts. Another gene poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 like, cytoplasmic (PABPN1L) showed suggestive significance in the discovery cohort (p < 1 x 10-4) and was replicated in the replication cohort (p = 0.009). The pathway analysis did not detect any significant pathway. Taken together, this study identified significant gene associations with contour integration and provided support for a genetic transmission of the ability to perceive continuous contours in the environment.

AB  - Background: Eye movement abnormalities have been identified in schizophrenia; however, their relevance to cognition is still unknown. In this study, we explored the general relationship between eye movements and cognitive function. Methods: The three eye movement measures (scanpath length, horizontal position gain, and duration of fixations) that were previously reported to be useful in distinguishing subjects with schizophrenia from healthy subjects, as well as Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) scores, were collected and tested for association in 113 subjects with schizophrenia and 404 healthy subjects. Results: Scanpath length was positively correlated with matrix reasoning and digit symbol coding in subjects with schizophrenia and correlated with vocabulary and symbol search in healthy subjects. Upon testing for interaction effects of diagnosis and scanpath length on correlated WAIS-III scores, a significant interaction effect was only observed for matrix reasoning. The positive correlation between scanpath length and matrix reasoning, which was specific to subjects with schizophrenia, remained significant after controlling for demographic confounders such as medication and negative symptoms. No correlation was observed between the two other eye movement measures and any of the WAIS-III scores. Conclusions: Herein, we reveal novel findings on the association between eye-movement-based measures of visual exploration and cognitive scores requiring visual search in subjects with schizophrenia and in healthy subjects. The association between scanpath length and matrix reasoning, a measure of perceptual organization in subjects with schizophrenia, implies the existence of common cognitive processes, and subjects with longer scanpath length may be advantageous in performance of perceptual organization tasks.

AB  - The predictive coding account of psychosis postulates the abnormal formation of prior beliefs in schizophrenia, resulting in psychotic symptoms. One domain in which priors play a crucial role is visual perception. For instance, our perception of brightness, line length, and motion direction are not merely based on a veridical extraction of sensory input but are also determined by expectation (or prior) of the stimulus. Formation of such priors is thought to be governed by the statistical regularities within natural scenes. Recently, the use of such priors has been attributed to a specific set of well-documented visual illusions, supporting the idea that perception is biased toward what is statistically more probable within the environment. The Predictive Coding account of psychosis proposes that patients form abnormal representations of statistical regularities in natural scenes, leading to altered perceptual experiences. Here we use classical vision experiments involving a specific set of visual illusions to directly test this hypothesis. We find that perceptual judgments for both patients and control participants are biased in accordance with reported probability distributions of natural scenes. Thus, despite there being a suggested link between visual abnormalities and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, our results provide no support for the notion that altered formation of priors is a general feature of the disorder. These data call for a refinement in the predictions of quantitative models of psychosis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

The Perceptual Organization Index had a significant negative correlation with trauma exposures only in met carriers, including early physical abuse, general trauma after age 18 years, and physical abuse. Within the Val66Val subgroup, there were no significant correlations between WAIS indices and traumatic experiences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The visual system is recognized as an important site of pathology and dysfunction in schizophrenia. In this study, we evaluated different visual perceptual functions in patients with psychotic disorders using a potentially clinically applicable task battery and assessed their relationship with symptom severity in patients, and with schizotypal features in healthy participants. Methods: Five different areas of visual functioning were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (n = 28) and healthy control subjects (n = 31) using a battery that included visuospatial working memory (VSWM), velocity discrimination (VD), contour integration, visual context processing, and backward masking tasks. Results: The patient group demonstrated significantly lower performance in VD, contour integration, and VSWM tasks. Performance did not differ between the two groups on the visual context processing task and did not differ across levels of interstimulus intervals in the backward masking task. Performances on VSWM, VD, and contour integration tasks were correlated with negative symptom severity but not with other symptom dimensions in the patient group. VSWM and VD performances were also correlated with negative sychizotypal features in healthy controls. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate significant abnormalities in multiple visual processing tasks in patients with psychotic disorders, adding to the literature implicating visual abnormalities in these conditions. Furthermore, our results show that visual processing impairments are associated with the negative symptom dimension in patients as well as healthy individuals.

AB  - There seems to be no common factor for visual perception, i.e., performance in visual tasks correlates only weakly with each other. Similar results were found with visual illusions. One may expect common visual factors for individuals suffering from pathologies that alter brain functioning, such as schizophrenia. For example, patients who are more severely affected by the disease, e.g., stronger positive symptoms, may show increased illusion magnitudes. Here, in the first experiment, we used a battery of seven visual illusions and a mental imagery questionnaire. Illusion magnitudes for the seven illusions did not differ significantly between the patients and controls. In addition, correlations between the different illusions and mental imagery were low. In the second experiment, we tested 59 patients (mostly outpatients) with ten visual illusions. As for the first experiment, patients and controls showed similar susceptibility to all but one visual illusion. Moreover, there were no significant correlations between different illusions, symptoms, or medication type. Thus, it seems that perception of visual illusions is mostly intact in schizophrenia.

AB  - Several studies have investigated perceptual processes in patients with schizophrenia. Research confirms that visual impairments are one of the most important features of schizophrenia. Many studies, using behavioral and psychological experiments, confirm that visual impairments can be used to determine illness severity, state, and best treatments. Herein, we review recent research pertaining to visual function in patients with schizophrenia and highlight the relationship between laboratory findings and subjective, real-life reports from patients themselves. The purpose of this review is to 1) describe visual impairments that manifest in patients with schizophrenia, 2) examine the relationship between visual dysfunction, assessed by laboratory tests, and the experiences of patients themselves, and 3) describe real-life experiences related to visual function in this population. In this review, the impairments of motion and color perception, perceptual organization, and scan paths are summarized, along with the relationship between laboratory findings and patients' real-world subjective experiences related to visual function.

AB  - Introduction: Impaired perceptual organisation in schizophrenia has been repeatedly described in clinical and research literatures. It has also been associated with problems in more complex aspects of visual function, including visuospatial and visual cognitive test performance. Two therapeutic interventions were developed here that target perceptual organisation: (1) Computer-based training, which emphasized stimulus-driven processing (bottom-up approach), and (2) Instrumental Enrichment therapy, which is a therapist-guided interactive learning method (topdown approach). Methods: Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a 12-week programme. For both forms of interventions, task difficulty increased progressively, based upon successful performance. The third group of patients, which served as controls, received a similar therapeutic intervention that did not include a perceptual organisation component. Before and after intervention, participants received tests of perceptual organisation, as well as a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results: Results indicate that both forms of intervention improved perceptual organisation ability relative to the control condition. In addition, the improvement was found for select neuropsychological tests, although the pattern of improvement did not favour capacities more closely associated with visual organisational or visuospatial function. Conclusions: Together, results demonstrate the effectiveness of new remediation protocols that target mid-level visual processing, which generalized to select visual cognitive functions.

AB  - Background: Prior studies have documented biological motion perception deficits in schizophrenia, but it remains unclear whether the impairments arise from poor social cognition, perceptual organization, basic motion processing, or sustained attention/motivation. To address the issue, we had 24 chronic schizophrenia patients and 27 healthy controls perform three tasks: coherent motion, where subjects indicated whether a cloud of dots drifted leftward or rightward; dynamic rigid form, where subjects determined the tilt direction of a translating, point-light rectangle; and biological motion, where subjects judged whether a human point-light figure walked leftward or rightward. Task difficulty was staircase controlled and depended on the directional variability of the background dot motion. Catch trials were added to verify task attentiveness and engagement. Results: Patients and controls demonstrated similar performance thresholds and near-ceiling catch trial accuracy for each task (uncorrected ps > 0.1; ds < 0.35). In all but the coherent motion task, higher IQ correlated with better performance (ps < 0.001). Conclusion: Schizophrenia patients have intact perception of motion coherence, dynamic rigid form, and biological motion at least for our sample and set-up. We speculate that previously documented biological motion perception deficits arose from task or stimulus differences or from group differences in IQ, attention, or motivation.

AB  - Introduction: "Body swapping" illusions have been used to explore factors contributing to the experience of "owning" an artificial body. Preliminary research indicated that those people diagnosed with schizophrenia experience more vivid illusions of this kind than do "normal" individuals. Objectives: Here, we explored whether participants who rated themselves "high" on the cognitive-perceptual factor of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) experienced a more compelling sense of immersion in a variation of the body swapping illusion: The Barbie Doll Illusion. We also hypothesised that these individuals would experience a change in size perception when immersed in the illusion. Method: Forty-four participants wore a pair of Head-Mounted Display goggles connected to a video-camera, and thus a doll's body replaced their own body in their visual field. In two conditions, touch was either applied synchronously or asynchronously to the doll's and each participant's leg. After each condition, participants filled out a questionnaire relating to their experience in the illusion. When both conditions were completed, they filled out the SPQ. Results: Our first hypothesis was confirmed, which suggested that people with higher cognitive-perceptual SPQ scores do indeed experience a more compelling Barbie Doll Illusion; however, our second hypothesis was not supported. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that proneness to the positive and interpersonal factors of schizotypy in a normal population is sufficient to produce a compelling sense of swapping bodies.

AB  - Background: Hallucinations may have a broad spectrum and include so-called minor hallucinations (MHs). MHs include passage hallucinations (PHs), visual illusions, and presence hallucinations (PrHs). Objective(s): To determine the prevalence and characteristics of MHs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and to describe their potential relationship with cognition, behavioral symptoms, and use of psychoactive drugs. Method(s): We have recruited prospectively and consecutively 268 subjects (90 AD mild-moderate drug-naive patients, 78 aMCI, and 100 controls). All patients responded to a semi-structured questionnaire in order to rate psychotic phenomena. Clinical, neuropsychological, and demographic data of patients with and without MH were compared with those of age, sex, and education-matched controls. Result(s): The prevalence of MHs was 21.1% (19) in AD, 12.8% (10) in aMCI, and 3% (3) in controls (p < 0.01). The most frequent MH was PrH (9.3%), followed by PH (4.9%) and illusion (0.7%). Eight (27.8%) patients had more than one MH. After adjusting for age and gender, there was a negative correlation between the presence of MHs and MMSE score (r = -0.261; p < 0.01) and a positive correlation between MHs and Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (r = 0.237; p < 0.01). We did not observe a significant relationship between presence of MHs and the consumption of psychoactive drugs (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): We have shown that the presence of MHs in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated AD and aMCI is more than controls. MHs were correlated with other behavioral symptoms and a worse cognitive performance. We suggest the specific interrogation for MHs as a clinical feature for this population.Copyright <c2><a9> 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Impaired visual integration is well documented in schizophrenia and related to functional outcomes. However, it is unclear if this deficit is specific to schizophrenia, or characteristic of psychosis more broadly. To address this question, this study used a Bayesian model comparison approach to examine the evidence of three grouping models of visual integration performance in 116 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SA), bipolar disorder (BD) with or without a history of prominent psychosis (BDP+ and BDP-, respectively), or no psychiatric diagnosis (healthy controls; HC). We compared: (1) Psychosis Model (psychosis, non-psychosis), where the psychosis group included SZ, SA, and BDP+, and the non-psychosis group included BDP- and HC; (2) Schizophrenia Model (SZ, non-SZ); and (3) DSM Model (SZ, SA, BD, HC). The relationship between visual integration and general cognition was also explored. The Psychosis Model showed the strongest evidence, and visual integration was associated with general cognition in participants with psychosis. The results were consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, indicating that visual integration impairment is characteristic of psychosis and not specific to SZ or DSM categories, and may share similar disease pathways with observed neurocognitive deficits in psychotic disorders.

AB  - Recent theories propose that schizophrenia/schizotypy and autistic spectrum disorder are related to impairments in Bayesian inference that is, how the brain integrates sensory information (likelihoods) with prior knowledge. However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals' likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations.Copyright <c2><a9> Karvelis et al.

AB  - Recent studies have shown the existence of two gamma rhythms in the hippocampus subserving different functions but, to date, primate studies in primary visual cortex have reported a single gamma rhythm. Here, we show that large visual stimuli induce a slow gamma (25-45 Hz) in area V1 of two awake adult female bonnet monkeys and in the EEG of 15 human subjects (7 males and 8 females), in addition to the traditionally known fast gamma (45-70 Hz). The two rhythms had different tuning characteristics for stimulus orientation, contrast, drift speed, and size. Further, fast gamma had short latency, strongly entrained spikes and was coherent over short distances, reflecting short-range processing, whereas slow gamma appeared to reflect long-range processing. Together, two gamma rhythms can potentially provide better coding or communication mechanisms and a more comprehensive biomarker for diagnosis of mental disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Gamma rhythm has been associated with high-level cognitive functions such as attention and feature binding and has been reported to be abnormal in brain disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Unlike previous studies that have shown a single gamma rhythm in the primate visual cortex, we found that large visual gratings induce two distinct gamma oscillations in both monkey LFP and human EEG. These rhythms, termed slow (25-45 Hz) and fast (45-70 Hz), exhibited distinct tuning preferences, latencies, and coherence profiles, potentially reflecting processing at two different ranges. Multiple gamma oscillations in visual cortex may provide a richer representation of external visual stimuli and could be used for developing brain-machine interfacing applications and screening tests for neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Background: Oxytocin is a peptide hormone that influences the integration of social cognition with behavior and affect regulation. Oxytocin also prominently directs the transition of neuronal GABA neurotransmission from excitatory to inhibitory after birth. The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) is linked to schizophrenia, a heterogeneous syndrome. Relationships of OXTR polymorphisms with specific clinical features could aid in evaluating any role of oxytocin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Method: Schizophrenia cases with rare missense coding OXTR single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified from a well-characterized sample of cases and controls who were assessed for symptoms, cognition and early life trauma. Results: Five of 48 cases showed rare OXTR variants. Compared to the other cases they had less severe negative symptoms (deficits in emotional expression and motivation) and less severe general psychopathology scores (depression and anxiety). They demonstrated lower nonverbal (performance) than verbal intelligence due to deficient perceptual organization and slow processing speed. They also reported greater early trauma exposure (physical and sexual abuse and emotional trauma). Conclusion: Cases carrying rare OXTR SNVs had less negative and affective symptoms than other cases, but similar psychotic symptoms, along with specific cognitive deficits. The clinical characterization of these cases occurred in association with environmental exposure to early trauma, especially sexual abuse, which may have influenced the expression of schizophrenia in subjects harboring specific SNVs in the OXTR.

AB  - According to a widely held view, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are characterized by a vague boundary between the perception of the external world and the inner imagery of persons, objects, and events. In this study, we addressed the perception-imagery debate in schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). Thirty individuals with SPD and 30 matched healthy subjects completed a lateral masking task. Participants were asked to detect a low-contrast Gabor patch flanked by two collinear Gabor masks. In the perceptual task, the masks were physically present, whereas in the imagery task, participants only imagined the masks. By applying a binocular rivalry paradigm, we also measured the imagery priming effect. Results revealed that, in the perceptual task, collinear masks similarly decreased contrast threshold in SPD and controls. In the imagery task, contrast threshold reduction (facilitation by the imagined masks) was more pronounced in SPD relative to the controls. In the binocular rivalry paradigm, individuals with SPD showed higher imagery priming effects as compared to healthy controls. Enhanced imagery was not related to schizotypal traits. These results indicate intact early visual perception and heightened imagery in SPD, which may be a trait marker of unusual experiences without psychotic disorganization.

AB  - Auditory scene analysis (ASA) dysfunction is likely an important component of the symptomatology of schizophrenia. Auditory object segmentation, the grouping of sequential acoustic elements into temporally-distinct auditory objects, can be assessed with electroencephalography through measurement of the auditory segmentation potential (ASP). Further, N2 responses to the initial and final elements of auditory objects are enhanced relative to medial elements, which may indicate auditory object edge detection (initiation and termination). Both ASP and N2 modulation are impaired in long-term schizophrenia. To determine whether these deficits are present early in disease course, we compared ASP and N2 modulation between individuals at their first episode of psychosis within the schizophrenia spectrum (FE, N = 20) and matched healthy controls (N = 24). The ASP was reduced by > 40% in FE; however, N2 modulation was not statistically different from HC. This suggests that auditory segmentation (ASP) deficits exist at this early stage of schizophrenia, but auditory edge detection (N2 modulation) is relatively intact. In a subset of subjects for whom structural MRIs were available (N = 14 per group), ASP sources were localized to midcingulate cortex (MCC) and temporal auditory cortex. Neurophysiological activity in FE was reduced in MCC, an area linked to aberrant perceptual organization, negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, but not temporal auditory cortex. This study supports the validity of the ASP for measurement of auditory object segmentation and suggests that the ASP may be useful as an early index of schizophrenia-related MCC dysfunction. Further, ASP deficits may serve as a viable biomarker of disease presence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Considering that psychosis in Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with worse outcomes, including dementia, we aimed to study the characteristics, correlates, and assessment of PD psychosis in those without dementia. Methods: 101 PD subjects without dementia (Montreal Cognitive Assessment >= 21/30) were recruited to participate in a study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD. This study included a baseline standard neurological exam and common PD symptom assessments. Using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and separate assessment of visual illusions and sense of presence, NINDS-NIMH criteria for PD psychosis were applied. Results: Of the 33 (32.7%) PD subjects who met diagnostic criteria for psychosis in PD, visual illusions were most common (72.7%), followed by visual hallucinations (39.4%). Adjusted for presence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (p = 0.097), use of dopamine agonists (OR = 3.7, p = 0.012) and greater autonomic symptom burden (OR = 1.1 (per 1-unit change in score on SCOPA-AUT), p = 0.012) were associated with greater risk of psychosis. Use of dopamine agonists (OR = 5.0, p = 0.007), higher MDS-UPDRS Part II score (OR = 1.1, p = 0.010), and presence of RBD (OR = 4.8, p = 0.012) were independent predictors of visual hallucinations and visual illusions. MDS-UPDRS item 1.2 score >= 1 had highly correlated with the SAPS score (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001), but was 42% sensitive and 96% specific for identifying psychosis. Conclusion: This study confirms the association between dopamine agonists and psychosis in PD patients without dementia. The association of RBD, autonomic symptoms, and MDS-UPDRS Part II scores with psychosis underscore its link to brainstem dysfunction and greater PD motor symptom severity.

AB  - Visual signals in the vertebrate retina are shaped by feedback and feedforward inhibition in two synaptic layers. In one, horizontal cells establish fundamental center-surround receptive-field properties via morphologically and physiologically complex synapses with photoreceptors and bipolar cells. In the other, a panoply of amacrine cells imbue ganglion cell responses with spatiotemporally complex information about the visual world. Here, I review current ideas about horizontal cell signaling, considering the evidence for and against the leading, competing theories. I also discuss recent work that has begun to make sense of the remarkable morphological and physiological diversity of amacrine cells. These latter efforts have been aided tremendously by increasingly complete connectivity maps of inner retinal circuitry and new genetic tools that enable study of individual, sparsely expressed amacrine cell types.

AB  - Objective: To describe a rare case of a patient who developed psychotic symptoms after a right stroke that disappeared with antipsychotic treatment, but appears to need low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy. Case description: A 65-year-old man presented at the psychiatric emergency service with a history of persistent delusional jealousy, visual illusions and agitation with onset about 1 month after a right posterior cerebral artery ischemic stroke. These symptoms only disappeared with therapeutic dosages of an antipsychotic drug (3 mg/day of risperidone). At 2-year follow-up, he no longer had delusional activity and the antipsychotic treatment was gradually discontinued over the following year. However, 1 week after full cessation, the patient once more became agitated and suspicious and was put back on risperidone at 0.25 mg/day, resulting in rapid clinical remission. One year after the return to low-dose risperidone, the patient's psychopathology is still under control and he is free from psychotic symptoms. Comments: Psychosis is a relatively rare complication after stroke. To our knowledge, no cases of post-stroke psychosis that apparently require continuous low-dose antipsychotic treatment have been reported to date. Our case suggests that low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy may be needed for certain patients with post-stroke psychosis, especially for those with risk factors and non-acute onset. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Portuguese) Objetivo: Descrever o caso raro de um paciente que desenvolveu sintomas psicoticos apos um acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) no nivel do hemisferio direito que remitiram com tratamento antipsicotico, mas parece precisar de uma terapeutica de manutencao com antipsicotico em baixa dosagem. Descricao de caso: Um homem de 65 anos apresentou-se no servico de urgencia psiquiatrica por um quadro persistente de delirio de ciumes, ilusoes visuais e agitacao com inicio cerca de 1 mes apos AVC isquemico no nivel da arteria cerebral posterior direita. Esses sintomas so desapareceram com doses terapeuticas de antipsicotico (risperidona 3 mg/dia). Apos 2 anos de seguimento, o paciente nao mais apresentava atividade delirante, e o tratamento antipsicotico foi progressivamente descontinuado durante o ano seguinte. No entanto, 1 semana apos a suspensao total, o paciente comecou a ficar agitado e desconfiado, tendo-se reiniciado a risperidona 0,25 mg/dia, com rapida remissao clinica. O paciente esta medicado com esta baixa dose de antipsicotico ha um ano, permanecendo psicopatologicamente compensado e sem sintomas psicoticos. Comentarios: A psicose e uma complicacao relativamente rara apos AVC. Segundo nosso conhecimento, nao ha casos descritos ate ao momento de psicose apos AVC que, aparentemente, requerem uma dose baixa continua de antipsicotico. Nosso caso sugere que uma terapeutica de manutencao com antipsicotico em baixa dosagem pode ser necessaria para determinados pacientes com psicose apos AVC, especialmente para aqueles com fatores de risco e inicio nao agudo dos sintomas.

AB  - Objective: Patients with Lewy body disease develop a variety of psychotic and misperception symptoms, including visual hallucinations and delusions, as well as 'minor hallucinations', that is, a sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions. Although these symptoms have been suggested to have common underlying mechanisms, the commonalities and differences among them have not been systematically investigated at the neural level. Methods: Sixty-seven patients with Parkinson's disease underwent neuropsychological and behavioural assessments, volumetric MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A factor analysis was performed to discover correlations among psychotic and misperception symptoms, other behavioural symptoms and neuropsychological performances. Partial least-squares correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and the joint features of MRI and FDG-PET. Results: A sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions constituted a single behavioural factor (minor hallucinations/illusions). Visual hallucinations formed another behavioural factor along with delusions, depression and fluctuating cognition (psychosis/dysphoria). Three distinct brain-behaviour correlation patterns were identified: (1) posterior cortical atrophy/hypometabolism associated with minor hallucinations/illusions and visuospatial impairment; (2) upper brainstem and thalamic atrophy/hypometabolism associated with psychosis/dysphoria and (3) frontal cortical atrophy/hypometabolism associated with non-visual cognition. No significant differences in neuroimaging findings were identified between patients who had minor hallucinations/illusions alone and patients who also had visual hallucinations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combined damage to the upper brainstem/thalamus and the posterior neocortex underlies both minor hallucinations/illusions and visual hallucinations and that the former pathology is more associated with visual hallucinations/ frank psychosis and the latter is more associated with minor hallucinations/illusions.

AB  - This study compared the levels of the five domains of neurocognitive function-executive function, attention, memory, verbal comprehension, and perceptual organization-among clinically stable individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder, individuals with long-term schizophrenia, and a group of controls. We recruited a total of 93 clinically stable individuals with bipolar I disorder, 94 individuals with schizophrenia, and 106 controls in this study. Their neurocognitive function was measured using a series of neurocognitive function tests: the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III), Line Cancellation Test, Visual Form Discrimination, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Continuous Performance Task, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition. Neurocognitive function was compared among the three groups through a multivariate analysis of variance. The results indicated that when the effect of age was controlled, clinically stable individuals with bipolar I disorder and those with schizophrenia demonstrated poor neurocognitive function on all tests except for the WAIS-III Similarity and Information and the Line Cancellation Test. The individuals with bipolar I disorder had similar levels of neurocognitive function compared with the schizophrenia group, but higher levels of neurocognitive function on the WAIS-III Comprehension, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition Auditory Immediate and Delayed Index and Visual Immediate and Delayed Index. The conclusions of this study suggest that compared with controls, individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder and those with long-term schizophrenia have poorer neurocognitive function, even when clinically stable. Individuals with long-term bipolar I disorder and those with long-term schizophrenia have similar levels of deficits in several domains of neurocognitive function. Copyright <c2><a9> 2017.

AB  - Introduction: In the present study we were interested in the processing of audio-visual integration in schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. The amount of sound-induced double-flash illusions served as an indicator of audio-visual integration. We expected an altered integration as well as a different window of temporal integration for patients. Methods: Fifteen schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy volunteers matched for age and gender were included in this study. We used stimuli with eight different temporal delays (stimulus onset asynchronys (SOAs) 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200 and 300 ms) to induce a double-flash illusion. Group differences and the widths of temporal integration windows were calculated on percentages of reported double-flash illusions. Results: Patients showed significantly more illusions (ca. 36-44% vs. 9-16% in control subjects) for SOAs 150-300. The temporal integration window for control participants went from SOAs 25 to 200 whereas for patients integration was found across all included temporal delays. We found no significant relationship between the amount of illusions and either illness severity, chlorpromazine equivalent doses or duration of illness in patients. Conclusions: Our results are interpreted in favour of an enlarged temporal integration window for audio-visual stimuli in schizophrenia patients, which is consistent with previous research.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 38(13) of The Journal of Neuroscience (see record 2018-15923-023). In the original article, there is an error in Figure 2, where the labels at the bottom of the two columns have been incorrectly switched. The correct labels are shown in the figure presented in the erratum and corrected on the online PDF version.] People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal visual perception on a range of visual tasks, which have been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. However, differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons, which might explain these visual anomalies, have yet to be reported in vivo. Here, we probed the neural basis of these deficits using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a difference-of-Gaussian model to capture the center-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2, and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Specific abnormalities of vision in schizophrenia have been observed to affect high-level and some low-level integration mechanisms, suggesting that people with schizophrenia may experience anomalies across different stages in the visual system affecting either early or late processing or both. Here, we review the research into visual illusion perception in schizophrenia and the issues which previous research has faced. One general finding that emerged from the literature is that those with schizophrenia are mostly immune to the effects of high-level illusory displays, but this effect is not consistent across all low-level illusions. The present review suggests that this resistance is due to the weakening of top-down perceptual mechanisms and may be relevant to the understanding of symptoms of visual distortion rather than hallucinations as previously thought.

AB  - Objective: Few studies have evaluated the effects of visual remediation strategies in schizophrenia despite abundant evidence of visual-processing alterations in this condition. We report preliminary, case-study-based evidence regarding the effects of visual remediation in this population. Method: We describe implementation of a visual-perceptual training program called ULTIMEYES (UE) and initial results through 3 brief case studies of individuals with schizophrenia. UE targets broad-based visual function, including low-level processes (e.g., acuity, contrast sensitivity) as well as higher level visual functions. Three inpatients, recruited from a research unit, participated in at least 38 sessions 3 to 4 times per week for approximately 25 min per session. Contrast sensitivity (a trained task), as well as acuity and perceptual organization (untrained tasks), were assessed before and after the intervention. Levels of progression through the task are also reported. Results: UE was well tolerated by the participants and led to improvements in contrast sensitivity, as well as more generalized gains in visual acuity in all 3 participants and perceptual organization in 2 participants. Symptom profiles were somewhat different for each participant, but all were symptomatic during the intervention. Despite this, they were able to focus on and benefit from training. The adaptive nature of the training was well suited to the slower progression of 2 participants. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: These case studies set the stage for further research, such as larger, randomized controlled trials of the intervention that include additional assessments of perceptual function and measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was an assessment of the phenomenon of depth perception in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects., METHODS: We conducted a comparison erroneous assessment of the concave side of the mask as convex, using the popular website presenting rotating Charlie Chaplin's mask. The study was performed in patients hospitalized at the Stanislaw Kryzan Psychiatric Hospital in Starogard Gdanski diagnosed with paranoid and undifferentiated schizophrenia based on ICD-10 criteria and control group matched for age and education; each group included 58 subjects., RESULTS: The correct perception of depth in the hollow mask illusion regards approx. 30% of patients with paranoid and undifferentiated schizophrenia during exacerbation and it is three times higher in this group than in the general population. Except the number of relapses and hospitalization in anamnesis, it shows no correlation with another clinical and demographic data such as: the age of onset, the duration of illness, and results on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)., CONCLUSIONS: The correct perception of the hollow mask may be potentially one of the subsequent premises for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in doubtful cases. The simplicity and general availability is also an argument for conducting the test.

AB  - Mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to deviation from physical sound parameters (e.g., pitch, duration) is reduced in individuals with long-term schizophrenia (Sz), suggesting deficits in deviance detection. However, MMN can appear at several time intervals as part of deviance detection. Understanding which part of the processing stream is abnormal in Sz is crucial for understanding MMN pathophysiology. We measured MMN to complex pattern deviants, which have been shown to produce multiple MMNs in healthy controls (HC). Both simple and complex MMNs were recorded from 27 Sz and 27 matched HC. For simple MMN, pitch- and duration-deviants were presented among frequent standard tones. For complex MMN, patterns of five single tones were repeatedly presented, with the occasional deviant group of tones containing an extra sixth tone. Sz showed smaller pitch MMN (p = 0.009, ~110 ms) and duration MMN (p = 0.030, ~170 ms) than healthy controls. For complex MMN, there were two deviance-related negativities. The first (~150 ms) was not significantly different between HC and SZ. The second was significantly reduced in Sz (p = 0.011, ~400 ms). The topography of the late complex MMN was consistent with generators in anterior temporal cortex. Worse late MMN in Sz was associated with increased emotional withdrawal, poor attention, lack of spontaneity/conversation, and increased preoccupation. Late MMN blunting in schizophrenia suggests a deficit in later stages of deviance processing. Correlations with negative symptoms measures are preliminary, but suggest that abnormal complex auditory perceptual processes may compound higher-order cognitive and social deficits in the disorder.

AB  - Recent findings indicate that the binding and synchronization of distributed neural activities are crucial for cognitive processes and consciousness. In addition, there is increasing evidence that disrupted feature binding is related to experiences of disintegration of consciousness in schizophrenia. These data suggest that the disrupted binding and disintegration of consciousness could be typically related to schizophrenia in terms of Bleuler's concept of "splitting". In this context, deficits in metacognitive capacity in schizophrenia may be conceptualized as a spectrum from more discrete to more synthetic activities, related to specific levels of neural binding and neurocognitive deficits. This review summarizes the recent research on metacognition and its relationship to deficits of conscious awareness that may be found in schizophrenia patients. Deficits in synthetic metacognition are likely linked to the integration of information during specific processes of neural binding. Those in turn may be related to a range of mental activities including reasoning style, learning potential and insight. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Segmentation of the acoustic environment into discrete percepts is an important facet of auditory scene analysis (ASA). Segmentation of auditory stimuli into perceptually meaningful and localizable groups is central to ASA in everyday situations; for example, separation of discrete words from continuous sentences when processing language. This is particularly relevant to schizophrenia, where deficits in perceptual organization have been linked to symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Here we examined event-related potentials in response to grouped tones to elucidate schizophrenia-related differences in acoustic segmentation. We report for the first time in healthy subjects a sustained potential that begins with group initiation and ends with the last tone of the group. These potentials were reduced in schizophrenia, with the greatest differences in responses to first and final tones. Importantly, reductions in sustained potentials in schizophrenia patients were associated with greater negative symptoms and deficits in IQ, working memory, learning, and social cognition. These results suggest deficits in auditory pattern segmentation in schizophrenia may compound deficits in many higher-order facets of the disorder.

AB  - Visual integration dysfunction characterizes schizophrenia, but prior studies have not yet established whether the problem arises by the first psychotic episode or worsens with illness duration. To investigate the issue, we compared chronic schizophrenia patients (SZs), first episode psychosis patients (FEs), and well-matched healthy controls on a brief but sensitive psychophysical task in which subjects attempted to locate an integrated shape embedded in noise. Task difficulty depended on the number of noise elements co-presented with the shape. For half of the experiment, the entire display was scaled down in size to produce a high spatial frequency (HSF) condition, which has been shown to worsen patient integration deficits. Catch trials-in which the circular target appeared without noise-were also added so as to confirm that subjects were paying adequate attention. We found that controls integrated contours under noisier conditions than FEs, who, in turn, integrated better than SZs. These differences, which were at times large in magnitude (d = 1.7), clearly emerged only for HSF displays. Catch trial accuracy was above 95% for each group and could not explain the foregoing differences. Prolonged illness duration predicted poorer HSF integration across patients, but age had little effect on controls, indicating that the former factor was driving the effect in patients. Taken together, a brief psychophysical task efficiently demonstrates large visual integration impairments in schizophrenia. The deficit arises by the first psychotic episode, worsens with illness duration, and may serve as a biomarker of illness progression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement General Scientific Summary-People with schizophrenia are less able to integrate visual information into coherent contours and shapes. This study demonstrates that, under certain conditions, integration deficits arise by the first psychotic episode and worsen with prolonged illness duration. These results suggest that aspects of perception are already compromised at illness onset and gradually worsen over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Psychotic phenomena can occur in non-clinical subjects. The goals of this study were to assess the prevalence of delusions, hallucinations and minor 'psychotic' phenomena (visual illusions, feeling of presence and passage hallucinations) and to describe the characteristics of the latter in a non-clinical older population. Methods: Three hundred and thirteen individuals aged 60 years and older, without cognitive deficits (according to mini-mental state examination scores) or patent psychotic disease, answered a structured questionnaire focusing on delusions, hallucinations and minor phenomena that they had experienced in the previous month. The study sample was stratified by age and gender according to French demographic characteristics. Results: Twenty per cent of participants reported one or more psychotic phenomena. These subjects did not differ from those without psychotic symptoms as regards their age,mini-mental state examination scores or education.Minor phenomena were the most common (13%). Hallucinations, in any sensory modality, occurred in 9% of participants. No verbal auditory hallucinations or delusions were reported. The prevalence of minor phenomena increased with age and was associated with the use of psychoactive drugs. Conclusion: By extending the spectrum of psychotic symptoms to minor phenomena, we found that psychotic symptoms were common in a non-clinical older population. Whether the increasing prevalence of minor phenomena with age is due to prodromal neurodegenerative disease or to other factors remains to be investigated.

AB  - Objective: Patients with schizophrenia are impaired in maintaining coherent perceptual experiences. This is reflected in the oscillatory theta response and can be investigated by visual illusions. Ambiguous stimuli elicit illusory perceptual switches while the stimulus remains unchanged. Methods: Theta responses elicited by an ambiguous and unambiguous control stimulus were measured using the EEG during time periods of perceptual switching and perceptual stability (non-switching). Results: For the ambiguous task, theta activity increased during perceptual switching in healthy controls only. For the unambiguous task, the switching-related increase of theta activity was larger in controls than in patients. This reduced modulation of the theta response seems not to be related to a general decrease of theta activity in patients. Conclusions: These findings may be related to disturbances in the spatio-temporal integration of neural activity in patients. Reporting ambiguous and unambiguous perceptual switches seems to be more demanding for patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls. Significance: This is one of the first studies on the neurophysiologic correlates of illusory perception in schizophrenia. Focussing on the relation between different brain states (such as switching and non-switching) might integrate different findings about altered theta oscillations in schizophrenia.

AB  - Objective: To longitudinally analyze the course of cognitive dimensions in schizophrenic women over a period of 31 years. Method: Accidental sampling. Developmental longitudinal design. Diagnosis according to the ICD-10. Thirty institutionalized women were evaluated using the WAIS on three separate occasions (in 1981, 1997, and 2012). The data were analyzed using a repeated measures split-plot method. Results: Patients scored one to two standard deviations below the average on the WAIS. At all three evaluation times, they scored consistently, significantly worse on Performance IQ scales than on Verbal IQ in the following sequence: Processing Speed (PS) < Perceptual Organization (PO) < Working Memory (WM) < Verbal Comprehension (VC). Longitudinally, there was a significant, linear average trend that was stable between the first and second assessments, with a significant drop in scores at the third evaluation on Performance IQ (eta2 = .586) and Verbal IQ scales (eta2 = .299). The same trend was observed in PS (eta2 = .655) and WM (eta2 = .438), while PO decreased across the three evaluations (eta2 = .509) and no difference in VC was found (eta2 = .126). Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia presented with a low cognitive level. Longitudinally, they had a stable, differential profile of WAIS factors until late life, when performance dropped significantly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome, varying between persons and over course of illness. In this and a companion article, we argue that comprehension of this condition or set of conditions may require combining a phenomenological perspective emphasizing disorders of basic-self experience ("ipseity disturbance") with a multidimensional appreciation of possible neurobiological correlates-both primary and secondary. Previous attempts to link phenomenology and neurobiology generally focus on a single neurocognitive factor. We consider diverse aspects of schizophrenia in light of a diverse, albeit interacting, set of neurocognitive abnormalities, examining both synchronic (structural) interdependence and diachronic (temporal) succession. In this article we focus on the primary or foundational role of early perceptual and motoric disturbances that affect perceptual organization and especially intermodal or multisensory perceptual integration ("perceptual dys-integration"). These disturbances are discussed in terms of their implications for three interconnected aspects of selfhood in schizophrenia, primary forms of: disrupted "hold" or "grip" on the world, hyperreflexivity, diminished self-presence (self-affection). Disturbances of organization or integration imply forms of perceptual incoherence or diminished cognitive coordination. The effect is to disrupt one's ability to apprehend the world in holistic, vital, or contextually grounded fashion, or to fully identify with or experience the unity of one's own body or thinking-thereby generating an early and profound (albeit often subtle) disruption or diminishment of basic or core self and of the sense of existing in a coherent world. We discuss interrelationships or possible complementarities between these three aspects, and consider their relevance for a neurodevelopmental account of schizophrenia.

AB  - Psychophysical surround suppression is believed to reflect inhibitory neuronal mechanisms in visual cortex. In recent years, two psychophysical measures of surround suppression have been much studied: (i) duration thresholds on a motion-discrimination task (which are worse for larger than for smaller stimuli) and (ii) contrast thresholds on a contrast-detection task (which are worse when grating stimuli are surrounded by a stimulus of the same orientation than when they are presented in isolation or surrounded by a stimulus of orthogonal orientation). Changes in both metrics have been linked to several different human conditions, including aging, differences in intelligence, and clinical disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and autism. However, the exact nature of the neuronal correlate underlying these phenomena remains unclear. Here, we use an individual-differences approach to test the hypothesis that both measures reflect the same property of the visual system, e.g., the strength of GABA-ergic inhibition across visual cortex. Under this hypothesis we would expect the two measures to be significantly positively correlated across individuals. In fact, they are not significantly correlated. In addition, we replicate the previously reported correlation between age and motion-discrimination surround suppression, but find no correlation between age and contrast-detection surround suppression. We conclude that the two forms of psychophysical surround suppression arise independently from different cortical mechanisms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The salience of a visual stimulus is often reduced by nearby stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression of perceived contrast, which may help in locating the borders of an object. Weaker surround suppression has been observed in schizophrenia but it is unclear whether this abnormality is present in other mental disorders with similar symptomatology, or is evident in people with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Method: By examining surround suppression among subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, their unaffected biological relatives and healthy controls we sought to determine whether diminished surround suppression was specific to schizophrenia, and if subjects with a genetic risk for either disorder would show similar deficits. Measuring perceived contrast in different surround conditions also allowed us to investigate how this suppression depends on the similarity of target and surrounding stimuli. Results: Surround suppression was weaker among schizophrenia patients regardless of surround configuration. Subjects with bipolar affective disorder showed an intermediate deficit, with stronger suppression than in schizophrenia but weaker than control subjects. Surround suppression was normal in relatives of both patient groups. Findings support a deficit in broadly tuned (rather than sharply orientation- or direction-selective) suppression mechanisms. Conclusions: Weak broadly tuned suppression during visual perception is evident in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, consistent with impaired gain control related to the clinical expression of these conditions.

AB  - Perception operates on an immense amount of incoming information that greatly exceeds the brain's processing capacity. Because of this fundamental limitation, the ability to suppress irrelevant information is a key determinant of perceptual efficiency. Here, I will review a series of studies investigating suppressive mechanisms in visual motion processing, namely perceptual suppression of large, background-like motions. These spatial suppression mechanisms are adaptive, operating only when sensory inputs are sufficiently robust to guarantee visibility. Converging correlational and causal evidence links these behavioral results with inhibitory center-surround mechanisms, namely those in cortical area MT. Spatial suppression is abnormally weak in several special populations, including the elderly and individuals with schizophrenia-a deficit that is evidenced by better-than-normal direction discriminations of large moving stimuli. Theoretical work shows that this abnormal weakening of spatial suppression should result in motion segregation deficits, but direct behavioral support of this hypothesis is lacking. Finally, I will argue that the ability to suppress information is a fundamental neural process that applies not only to perception but also to cognition in general. Supporting this argument, I will discuss recent research that shows individual differences in spatial suppression of motion signals strongly predict individual variations in IQ scores.

AB  - Impaired visual context processing is closely linked with expression of symptoms in people with psychosis. However, to date, there have been no investigations of this phenomenon in the critical ultra high-risk (UHR) period immediately preceding the onset of psychosis. In total, 73 participants (33 UHR, 40 control) were evaluated with clinical and global functioning interviews and with a computerized task that required comparing the size of 2 target circles. Targets could appear by themselves (no-context condition), or within a context that made size judgment easier (helpful condition) or more difficult (misleading condition). Susceptibility to illusion was measured as the accuracy differences between the no-context and the helpful (i.e., helpful-index) and the misleading (i.e., misleading-index) conditions. Both groups exhibited approximately the same percentage of accurate responses to the no-context condition. However, the UHR subjects exhibited significantly less susceptibility to the illusion, performing superior to controls on the misleading index. The UHR group also showed less susceptibility on the helpful index, but this was not significant. Lower susceptibility on the misleading index was associated with increased negative symptoms and role functioning at a trend level. Lower susceptibility on the helpful index was significantly associated with increased negative symptoms and both poor role and social functioning. These results indicate that visual context processing is impaired during the UHR period, and is related to core illness features, suggesting that this task may be a useful biomarker in studies of UHR participants.

This study reports findings that high-risk youth appear to be less affected by visual illusions than matched controls, and this altered visual perception is associated with negative symptoms as well as real-world social and occupational functioning.

AB  - People with schizophrenia are impaired at organizing potentially ambiguous visual information into well-formed shape and object representations. This perceptual organization (PO) impairment has not been found in other psychiatric disorders. However, recent data on body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), suggest that BDD may also be characterized by reduced PO. Similarities between these groups could have implications for understanding the RDoC dimension of visual perception in psychopathology, and for modeling symptom formation across these two conditions. We compared patients with SCZ (n = 24) to those with BDD (n = 20), as well as control groups of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20), on two measures of PO that have been reliably associated with schizophrenia-related performance impairment. On both the contour integration and Ebbinghaus illusion tests, only the SCZ group demonstrated abnormal performance relative to controls; the BDD group performed similarly to the OCD and CON groups. In addition, on both tasks, the SCZ group performed more abnormally than the BDD group. Overall, these data suggest that PO reductions observed in SCZ are not present in BDD. Visual processing impairments in BDD may arise instead from other perceptual disturbances or attentional biases related to emotional factors.

AB  - Objectives: Visual perceptual organization impairments in schizophrenia (SCZ) are well established, but their neurobiological bases are not. The current study used the previously validated Jittered Orientation Visual Integration (JOVI) task, along with fMRI, to examine the neural basis of contour integration (CI), and its impairment in SCZ. CI is an aspect of perceptual organization in which multiple distinct oriented elements are grouped into a single continuous boundary or shape. Methods: On the JOVI, five levels of orientational jitter were added to non-contiguous closed contour elements embedded in background noise to progressively increase the difficulty in perceiving contour elements as left- or right-pointing ovals. Multi-site fMRI data were analyzed for 56 healthy control subjects and 47 people with SCZ. Results: SCZ patients demonstrated poorer CI, and this was associated with increased activation in regions involved in global shape processing and visual attention, namely the lateral occipital complex and superior parietal lobules. There were no brain regions where controls demonstrated more activation than patients. Conclusions: CI impairment in this sample of outpatients with SCZ was related to excessive activation in regions associated with object processing and allocation of visual-spatial attention. There was no evidence for basic impairments in contour element linking in the fMRI data. The latter may be limited to poor outcome patients, where more extensive structural and functional changes in the occipital lobe have been observed.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that coordinated activity within specific functional brain networks supports cognitive ability, and that abnormalities in brain connectivity may underlie cognitive deficits observed in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia. Two functional networks, the fronto-parietal network (FPN) and cingulo-opercular network (CON), are hypothesized to support top-down control of executive functioning, and have therefore emerged as potential drivers of cognitive impairment in disease-states. Graph theoretic analyses of functional connectivity data can characterize network topology, allowing the relationships between cognitive ability and network integrity to be examined. In the current study we applied graph analysis to pseudo-resting state data in 54 healthy subjects and 46 schizophrenia patients, and measured overall cognitive ability as the shared variance in performance from tasks of episodic memory, verbal memory, processing speed, goal maintenance, and visual integration. We found that, across all participants, cognitive ability was significantly positively associated with the local and global efficiency of the whole brain, FPN, and CON, but not with the efficiency of a comparison network, the auditory network. Additionally, the participation coefficient of the right anterior insula, a major hub within the CON, significantly predicted cognition, and this relationship was independent of CON global efficiency. Surprisingly, we did not observe strong evidence for group differences in any of our network metrics. These data suggest that functionally efficient task control networks support better cognitive ability in both health and schizophrenia, and that the right anterior insula may be a particularly important hub for successful cognitive performance across both health and disease.

AB  - Background: Pareidolia, which is a particular type of complex visual illusion, has been reported to be a phenomenon analogous to visual hallucinations in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. However, whether pareidolia is observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) or whether there are common underlying mechanisms of these two types of visual misperceptions remains to be elucidated. Methods: A test to evoke pareidolia, the Pareidolia test, was administered to 53 patients with PD without dementia and 24 healthy controls. The regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the PD patients. Results: PD patients without dementia produced a greater number of pareidolic illusions compared with the controls. Pareidolia was observed in all of the patients having visual hallucinations as well as a subset of those without visual hallucinations. The number of pareidolic illusions was correlated with hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices. The index of visual hallucinations was correlated with hypometabolism in the left parietal cortex. A region associated with both pareidolia and visual hallucinations was found in the left parietal lobe. Conclusions: Our study suggests that PD patients without dementia experience pareidolia more frequently than healthy controls and that posterior cortical dysfunction could be a common neural mechanism of pareidolia and visual hallucinations. Pareidolia could represent subclinical hallucinations or a predisposition to visual hallucinations in Lewy body disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Schizophrenia patients exhibit well-documented visual processing deficits. One area of disruption is visual integration, the ability to form global objects from local elements. However, most studies of visual integration in schizophrenia have been conducted in the context of an active attention task, which may influence the findings. In this study we examined visual integration using electroencephalography (EEG) in a passive task to elucidate neural mechanisms associated with poor visual integration. Forty-six schizophrenia patients and 30 healthy controls had EEG recorded while passively viewing figures comprised of real, illusory, or no contours. We examined visual P100, N100, and P200 event-related potential (ERP) components, as well as neural synchronization in the gamma (30-60 Hz) band assessed by the EEG phase locking factor (PLF). The N100 was significantly larger to illusory vs. no contour, and illusory vs. real contour stimuli while the P200 was larger only to real vs. illusory stimuli; there were no significant interactions with group. Compared to controls, patients failed to show increased phase locking to illusory versus no contours between 40-60 Hz. Also, controls, but not patients, had larger PLF between 30-40 Hz when viewing real vs. illusory contours. Finally, the positive symptom factor of the BPRS was negatively correlated with PLF values between 40-60 Hz to illusory stimuli, and with PLF between 30-40 Hz to real contour stimuli. These results suggest that the pattern of results across visual processing conditions is similar in patients and controls. However, patients have deficits in neural synchronization in the gamma range during basic processing of illusory contours when attentional demand is limited.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14(6)[e0218466] of PLoS ONE (see record 2019-33509-001). In the original article the following information is missing from the Funding statement: This study was supported by the European Research Council Executive Agency (ERC).] Schizophrenia has been linked to impaired performance on a range of visual processing tasks (e.g. detection of coherent motion and contour detection). It has been proposed that this is due to a general inability to integrate visual information at a global level. To test this theory, we assessed the performance of people with schizophrenia on a battery of tasks designed to probe voluntary averaging in different visual domains. Twenty-three outpatients with schizophrenia (mean age: 40+/-8 years; 3 female) and 20 age-matched control participants (mean age 39+/-9 years; 3 female) performed a motion coherence task and three equivalent noise (averaging) tasks, the latter allowing independent quantification of local and global limits on visual processing of motion, orientation and size. All performance measures were indistinguishable between the two groups (ps>0.05, one-way ANCOVAs), with one exception: participants with schizophrenia pooled fewer estimates of local orientation than controls when estimating average orientation (p = 0.01, one-way ANCOVA). These data do not support the notion of a generalised visual integration deficit in schizophrenia. Instead, they suggest that distinct visual dimensions are differentially affected in schizophrenia, with a specific impairment in the integration of visual orientation information.

AB  - Objective: A number of cognitive underpinnings of auditory hallucinations have been established in schizophrenia patients, but few have, as yet, been uncovered for visual hallucinations. In previous research, we unexpectedly observed that auditory hallucinations were associated with poor recognition of color, but not black-and-white (b/w), pictures. In this study, we attempted to replicate and explain this finding. Potential associations with visual hallucinations were explored. Method: B/w and color pictures were presented to 50 schizophrenia patients and 45 healthy individuals under 2 conditions of visual context presentation corresponding to 2 levels of visual encoding complexity. Then, participants had to recognize the target pictures among distractors. Results: Auditory-verbal hallucinations were inversely associated with the recognition of the color pictures presented under the most effortful encoding condition. This association was fully mediated by working-memory span. Visual hallucinations were associated with improved recognition of the color pictures presented under the less effortful condition. Patients suffering from visual hallucinations were not impaired, relative to the healthy participants, in the recognition of these pictures. Conclusion: Decreased working-memory span in patients with auditory-verbal hallucinations might impede the effortful encoding of stimuli. Visual hallucinations might be associated with facilitation in the visual encoding of natural scenes, or with enhanced color perception abilities.

AB  - We describe empirically derived categories of NSS in first episode schizophrenia among indigenous Africans. A total of 84 Nigerian patients with the disease were assessed using the neurological evaluation scale. An exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation was first conducted and the factors derived based on a priori criteria were subjected to confirmatory analyses using SPSS 18.0 and AMOS 18.0. We tested four different competing models to identify the structure with the best fit to the data. The relationship of the derived NSS structure with the clinical characteristics of schizophrenia was then explored using the Pearson correlation method. The overall clinical status was assessed using the positive and negative syndrome scale and clinical global impression. Additional assessments included the pre-morbid adjustment scale and calgary depression scale for schizophrenia. A three factor structure in which stereognosis is prescribed to load into a 'perceptual and motor sequencing' category (audio-visual integration, fist-edge palm, rhythm tapping, extinction, right-left confusion) provided the best fit to the data (chi-square goodness of fit test. =. 1.25; comparative fit index. =. 0.95; root square means error of approximation <0.05). The other two factors were: 'eye movement' (synkinesis, convergence, gaze impersistence) and 'motor co-ordination and graphaesthesia' (Tandem walk, adventitious flow, graphaesthesia). The signs were associated with severe negative (. r=. 0.456, p<. 0.001), and disorganization (. r=. 0.559, p<. 0.001) psychopathologies. NSS in this sample are heterogeneous, but aggregates into three correlated categories with significant overlap with previously described classifications.Copyright <c2><a9> 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - A well-studied paradox of motion perception is that, in order to correctly judge direction in high-contrast stimuli, subjects need to observe motion for longer in large stimuli than in small stimuli. This effect is one of several perceptual effects known generally as "surround suppression." It is usually attributed to center-surround antagonism between neurons in visual cortex, believed to be mediated by GABAergic inhibition. Accordingly, several studies have reported that this index of surround suppression is reduced in groups known to have reduced GABA-ergic inhibition, including older people and people with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In this study,we examined the effect on this index of moderate amounts of ethanol alcohol. Among its many effects on the nervous system, alcohol potentiates GABA-ergic transmission.We therefore hypothesized that it should further impair the perception of motion in large stimuli, resulting in a stronger surround-suppression index. This prediction was not borne out. Alcohol consumption slightly worsened duration thresholds for both large and small stimuli, but their ratio did not change significantly.

AB  - Schizophrenia patients poorly perceive Kanizsa figures and integrate co-aligned contour elements (Gabors). They also poorly process low spatial frequencies (SFs), which presumably reflects dysfunction along the dorsal pathway. Can contour grouping deficits be explained in terms of the spatial frequency content of the display elements? To address the question, we tested patients and matched controls on three contour grouping paradigms in which the SF composition was modulated. In the Kanizsa task, subjects discriminated quartets of sectored circles (:pac-men") that either formed or did not form Kanizsa shapes (illusory and fragmented conditions, respectively). In contour integration, subjects identified the screen quadrant thought to contain a closed chain of co-circular Gabors. In collinear facilitation, subjects attempted to detect a central low-contrast element flanked by collinear or orthogonal high-contrast elements, and facilitation corresponded to the amount by which collinear flankers reduced contrast thresholds. We varied SF by modifying the element features in the Kanizsa task and by scaling the entire stimulus display in the remaining tasks (SFs ranging from 4 to 12 cycles/deg). Irrespective of SF, patients were worse at discriminating illusory, but not fragmented shapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, collinear facilitation and contour integration were abnormal in the clinical group only for the higher SF (> = 10 c/deg). Grouping performance correlated with clinical variables, such as conceptual disorganization, general symptoms, and levels of functioning. In schizophrenia, three forms of contour grouping impairments prominently arise and cannot be attributed to poor low SF processing. Neurobiological and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Vertebrate vision relies on two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which signal increments in light intensity with graded hyperpolarizations. Rods operate in the lower range of light intensities while cones operate at brighter intensities. The receptive fields of both photoreceptors exhibit antagonistic center-surround organization. Here we show that at bright light levels, mouse rods act as relay cells for cone-driven horizontal cell-mediated surround inhibition. In response to large, bright stimuli that activate their surrounds, rods depolarize. Rod depolarization increases with stimulus size, and its action spectrum matches that of cones. Rod responses at high light levels are abolished in mice with nonfunctional cones and when horizontal cells are reversibly inactivated. Rod depolarization is conveyed to the inner retina via postsynaptic circuit elements, namely the rod bipolar cells. Our results show that the retinal circuitry repurposes rods, when they are not directly sensing light, to relay cone-driven surround inhibition.

AB  - Contour integration is a fundamental visual process that recovers object structure by representing spatially separated edge elements as a continuous contour or shape boundary. Clinically stable persons with schizophrenia have repeatedly been shown to be impaired at contour integration but it is unclear whether this process varies with clinical state or whether it arises as early as the first episode of psychosis. To consider these issues, we administered a contour integration test to persons with chronic schizophrenia and to those with a first episode of psychosis. The test was administered twice-once at admission to short term psychiatric hospitalization and once again at discharge. A well-matched healthy control group was also tested across the same time points. We found that contour integration performance improved to the same degree in all groups over time, indicating that there were no recovery effects over and above normal practice effects. Moreover, the schizophrenia group demonstrated poorer contour integration than the control group and the first episode group exhibited intermediate performance that could not be distinguished from the other groups. These results suggest that contour integration ability does not vary as a function of short-term changes in clinical state, and that it may become further impaired with an increased number of psychotic episodes.

AB  - Background: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in context processing. These deficits can be characterized by examining the influence of auditory context on ERP responses to rare target tones. Previous studies demonstrate that target ERP deficits in schizophrenia depend on the number of non-targets that precede the target ERP. Our goal was to extend these findings by examining whether patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to subtle differences in the auditory context preceding rare target stimuli, as quantified by Itti and Baldi's Bayesian prediction error model. Methods: Cortical responses to auditory oddball tones were measured within 59 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and 59 controls (HC). Individual trial amplitudes were estimated by conducting group ICA on the EEG time series and analyzing the reconstructed individual temporal sources. We quantified the auditory context of target tones using the Bayesian prediction error model and determined whether ERP amplitudes to tones were sensitive to this measure of context, or the number of preceding non-targets directly, within HC and SZ. Results: Individuals with schizophrenia show a significant reduction in ERP response amplitudes to targets approximately 244-412ms following target onsets. Individual amplitudes within this window showed significantly greater sensitivity to the modeled prediction error within the controls than in individuals with schizophrenia. These differences approached significance when examining differences in amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding non-targets. Conclusions: These findings further clarify differences in HC and SZ with regard to their attentional and perceptual sensitivity to subtle environmental regularities.

AB  - gamma-Tubulin is essential for the nucleation and organization of mitotic microtubules in dividing cells. It is localized at the microtubule organizing centers and mitotic spindle fibres. The most well accepted hypothesis for the initiation of microtubule polymerization is that alpha/beta-tubulin dimers add onto a gamma-tubulin ring complex (gammaTuRC), in which adjacent gamma-tubulin subunits bind to the underlying non-tubulin components of the gammaTuRC. This template thus determines the resulting microtubule lattice. In this study we use molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, combined with computational MM-PBSA/MM-GBSA methods, to determine the extent of the lateral atomic interaction between two adjacent gamma-tubulins within the gammaTuRC. To do this we simulated a gamma-gamma homodimer for 10 ns and calculated the ensemble average of binding free energies of -107.76 kcal/mol by the MM-PBSA method and of -87.12 kcal/mol by the MM-GBSA method. These highly favourable binding free energy values imply robust lateral interactions between adjacent gamma-tubulin subunits in addition to their end-interactions longitudinally with other proteins of gammaTuRC. Although the functional reconstitution of gamma-TuRC subunits and their stepwise in vitro assembly from purified components is not yet feasible, we nevertheless wanted to recognize hotspot amino acids responsible for key gamma-gamma interactions. Our free energy decomposition data from converting a compendium of amino acid residues identified an array of hotspot amino acids. A subset of such mutants can be expressed in vivo in living yeast. Because gammaTuRC is important for the growth of yeast, we could test whether this subset of the hotspot mutations support growth of yeast. Consistent with our model, gamma-tubulin mutants that fall into our identified hotspot do not support yeast growth.

AB  - The perceived orientation of a line or grating is affected by the orientation structure of the surrounding image: the tilt illusion. Here, I offer a selective review of the literature on the tilt illusion, focusing on functional aspects. The review explores the merits of mechanistic accounts of the tilt illusion based upon sensory gain control in which neuronal responses are normalized by the pooled activity of other units. The role of inhibition between orientation-selective neurons is discussed, and it is argued that their associated disinhibition must also be taken into account in order to model the full angular dependence of the tilt illusion on surround orientation. Parallels are drawn with adaptation as modulation by the temporal rather than spatial context within which an image fragment is processed. The chromatic selectivity of the tilt illusion and the extent of its dependence on the visibility of the surround are used to infer characteristics of the neuronal normalization pools and the loci in the cortical processing hierarchy at which gain control operates. Finally, recent evidence is discussed as to the possible clinical relevance of the tilt illusion as a biomarker for schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Coherent perception of the visual world requires orderly processing of spatially and temporally distributed visual information across the visual field. The organization of this visual information is impaired in schizophrenia. We previously found that visual temporal integration in patients is prolonged, using flashes presented to the central fovea. In this study, we investigated this temporal interaction in both the fovea and fairly far out in the peripheral visual field. Method(s): We used a 'three-flash' illusion paradigm in which two spatially-coincident light pulses (of 1. ms each) are perceived by healthy individuals as one, two or three flashes depending on the time interval between the pulses. In each trial, two light pulses were presented in the fovea or 34degree out in the right visual field. The inter-stimulus pulse interval (ISI) ranged from 30 to 310. ms. The task for patients (n= 28) and controls (n= 26) was to indicate the number of flashes (one, two or three) perceived after each two-pulse presentation. Result(s): For the controls, the peak of the three-flash illusion was shifted to longer ISIs (150. ms) in the periphery compared to the fovea (110. ms). For the patients, the three-flash illusion was greater and occurred at longer ISIs (270. ms in the periphery and 190. ms at the fovea). Conclusion(s): Compared to the central visual field, the range of temporal interactions in the periphery is prolonged to a greater extent in schizophrenia. This exacerbated temporal expansion in peripheral vision suggests a coarse temporal resolution for visual and cognitive organization in this mental disorder. <c2><a9> 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an ensemble synchronization measure across all EEG channel pairs of a cluster based on Frobenius norm of the phase synchronization matrix, in a 0-1 scale enabling a direct comparison between clusters with different number of channels. Using this metric, we studied the intrahemispheric EEG synchronization in the lower gamma band (30-40 Hz) during 1229 single trials of an audio-visual integration cross modal task (CMT) recorded from five patients with schizophrenia and five healthy control subjects. Using ensemble synchronization measure and response latency of single trials recorded during the CMT as features for logistic regression, we could classify each single trial of EEG as belonging to a patient with schizophrenia or a healthy control subject with 73% accuracy, with an area under receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.83. We also propose a likelihood rating to denote the possibility of a subject belonging to the schizophrenia group. <c2><a9> 2013 IEEE.

AB  - A subgroup of people with schizophrenia is characterized by reduced organization in perception, thought, language, and motor functioning, and these impairments covary significantly. While this may reflect multiple expressions of an illness-related core processing impairment, it may also represent the extreme end of an organization-disorganization dimension that is found throughout the general population. In this view, disorganization is a modifying influence on illness expression. To obtain preliminary information on this hypothesis, we examined covariation of perceptual and cognitive organization in a non-patient sample. Subjects completed a battery of perceptual tasks with demonstrated sensitivity to schizophrenia and disorganization, and a battery of questionnaires examining cognitive organization. Our results indicated that level of perceptual organization ability, across multiple tasks, was associated with self-reported levels of cognitive organization on multiple measures. This is thus preliminary evidence for a common process affecting perceptual and cognitive organization in the general population, suggesting that disorganization may reflect a modifying influence mechanism, instead of an illness-related process, in schizophrenia.

AB  - Studies revealed that patients with paranoid schizophrenia display overconfidence in errors for memory and social cognition tasks. The present investigation examined whether this pattern holds true for visual perception tasks. Nonclinical participants were recruited via an online panel. Individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire that included the Paranoia Checklist and were then presented with 24 blurry pictures; half contained a hidden object while the other half showed snowy (visual) noise. Participants were asked to state whether the visual items contained an object and how confident they were in their judgment. Data from 1966 individuals were included following a conservative selection process. Participants high on core paranoid symptoms showed a poor calibration of confidence for correct versus incorrect responses. In particular, participants high on paranoia displayed overconfidence in incorrect responses and demonstrated a 20% error rate for responses made with high confidence compared to a 12% error rate in participants with low paranoia scores. Interestingly, paranoia scores declined after performance of the task. For the first time, overconfidence in errors was demonstrated among individuals with high levels of paranoia using a visual perception task, tentatively suggesting it is a ubiquitous phenomenon. In view of the significant decline in paranoia across time, bias modification programs may incorporate items such as the one employed here to teach patients with clinical paranoia the fallibility of human cognition, which may foster subsequent symptom improvement.

Here, we extend prior research by reporting on temporal stability, as well as age and sex effects, for cognitive neuroscience paradigms optimized as part of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical applications for Schizophrenia consortium. Ninety-nine outpatients with schizophrenia and 131 healthy controls performed 5 tasks assessing 4 constructs at 3 sessions. The constructs were (1) Goal maintenance (Dot Probe Expectancy [DPX] and AX continuous performance tasks [AX-CPT]); (2) Episodic memory (Relational and Item-Specific Encoding and Retrieval task [RiSE]); (3) Visual integration (Jittered Orientation Visual Integration task [JOVI]); and (4) Perceptual gain control (Contrast- Contrast Effect Task [CCE]). Patients performed worse than controls on all but the CCE, and the magnitude of these group differences was stable across sessions, with no sex differences observed. Improvements over sessions were seen for the AX-CPT, the DPX, and the JOVI though practice effects for the AX-CPT and the DPX were primarily present in older participants. For the AX-CPT and the JOVI, practice effects were larger for T1 to T2 than for T2 to T3. Age was associated with poor associative recognition on the RiSE and accuracy on the JOVI. Test-rest reliability ranged from poor for the JOVI threshold score to adequate to good for the DPX, AX-CPT, and JOVI accuracy measures, with RiSE and CCE measures in the moderate range. These results suggest that group differences in DPX, AX-CPT, RiSE, and JOVI are robust and consistent across repeated testing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate a wide range of social cognitive deficits that significantly compromise functioning. Early visual processing is frequently disrupted in schizophrenia, and growing evidence suggests a role of perceptual dysfunctions in socioemotional functioning in the disorder. This study examined visual integration (the ability to effectively integrate individual, local visual features into a holistic representation), a target construct of basic perception identified by the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative, and its relationship with eye-contact perception and emotional intelligence in schizophrenia. Methods: Twenty-nine participants with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 23 healthy controls (HC) completed tasks measuring visual integration (Coherent Motion Task, Contour Integration Task), an eye-contact perception task, and a measure of emotional intelligence. Results: SCZ participants showed compromised visual integration as suggested by poorer performance on the Contour Integration Task relative to HC. Visual integration was a significant predictor of eye-contact perception and emotional intelligence among SCZ. The amounts of variances in these 2 social cognitive areas accounted for by visual integration were comparable to and overlapped with those accounted for by the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia showed compromised visual integration, and this may play a significant role in the observed deficits in higher level processing of social information in the disorder.

AB  - Background: Detection of visual contours (strings of small oriented elements) is markedly poor in schizophrenia. This has previously been attributed to an inability to group local information across space into a global percept. Here, we show that this failure actually originates from a combination of poor encoding of local orientation and abnormal processing of visual context. Method(s): We measured the ability of observers with schizophrenia to localise contours embedded in backgrounds of differently oriented elements (either randomly oriented, near-parallel or near-perpendicular to the contour). In addition, we measured patients' ability to process local orientation information (i.e., report the orientation of an individual element) for both isolated and crowded elements (i.e., presented with nearby distractors). Result(s): While patients are poor at detecting contours amongst randomly oriented elements, they are proportionally less disrupted (compared to unaffected controls) when contour and surrounding elements have similar orientations (near-parallel condition). In addition, patients are poor at reporting the orientation of an individual element but, again, are less prone to interference from nearby distractors, a phenomenon known as visual crowding. Conclusion(s): We suggest that patients' poor performance at contour perception arises not as a consequence of an "integration deficit" but from a combination of reduced sensitivity to local orientation and abnormalities in contextual processing. We propose that this is a consequence of abnormal gain control, a phenomenon that has been implicated in orientation-selectivity as well as surround suppression. <c2><a9> 2013 Robol et al.

AB  - Introduction: High-frequency oscillations are important for sensory processing and dysfunctions in the amplitude and synchrony of beta- and gamma-band oscillations have been demonstrated in schizophrenia (ScZ). However, the presence of aberrant high-frequency oscillations in first-episode (FE), medication-naive patients during sensory processing is unclear. Method(s): Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were recorded from 15 never-medicated, FE-ScZ patients and 20 matched healthy controls during the perception of Mooney faces. MEG data were analysed for spectral power and single-sensor phase-locking in the beta (13-25. Hz) and gamma- (25-140. Hz) frequency range. Result(s): FE-ScZ patients were characterized by significantly impaired sensory processing as indicated by a reduced discrimination index (A'). Impaired behavioural performance in ScZ-patients was accompanied by decreased spectral power in the high- (60-120. Hz) gamma-band range. In contrast, oscillations in the lower (25-60. Hz) gamma-band were largely intact and beta-band oscillations were increased. Analysis of cross-frequency coupling showed a reduced correlation between 60 and 120. Hz amplitude values and beta-band power in FE-ScZ-patients relative to controls. Discussion(s): Our findings show that impaired sensory processing in medication-naive, FE-schizophrenia is related to a dysregulation of neural oscillations which involves both an impairment in the generation of high gamma-band activity as well as a failure to downregulate task-irrelevant beta-band activity. Because of the interrelationship of these dysfunctions and the role of inhibitory networks in the shaping of high-frequency activity, aberrant neural oscillations in FE-schizophrenia may be linked to dysfunctions in the excitation-inhibition (E/I)-balance. <c2><a9> 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Schizophrenia patients demonstrate perceptual deficits consistent with broad dysfunction in visual context processing. These include poor integration of segments forming visual contours, and reduced visual contrast effects (e.g. weaker orientation-dependent surround suppression, ODSS). Background image context can influence contour perception, as stimuli near the contour affect detection accuracy. Because of ODSS, this contextual modulation depends on the relative orientation between the contour and flanking elements, with parallel flankers impairing contour perception. However in schizophrenia, the impact of abnormal ODSS during contour perception is not clear. It is also unknown whether deficient contour perception marks genetic liability for schizophrenia, or is strictly associated with clinical expression of this disorder. We examined contour detection in 25 adults with schizophrenia, 13 unaffected first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients, and 28 healthy controls. Subjects performed a psychophysics experiment designed to quantify the effect of flanker orientation during contour detection. Overall, patients with schizophrenia showed poorer contour detection performance than relatives or controls. Parallel flankers suppressed and orthogonal flankers enhanced contour detection performance for all groups, but parallel suppression was relatively weaker for schizophrenia patients than healthy controls. Relatives of patients showed equivalent performance with controls. Computational modeling suggested that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia may be explained by suppression that is more broadly tuned for orientation. Abnormal flanker suppression in schizophrenia is consistent with weaker ODSS and/or broader orientation tuning. This work provides the first evidence that such perceptual abnormalities may not be associated with a genetic liability for schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

A breakout group at the meeting addressed candidate tests in animals that might best parallel the human paradigms selected previously in the CNTRICS program to assess two constructs in the domain of perception: gain control and visual integration. The perception breakout group evaluated the degree to which each of the nominated tasks met pre-specified criteria: comparability of tasks across multiple species; construct validity; neuroanatomical homology between species; and dynamic range across parametric variation.

AB  - Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 microg/kg vs placebo) on both alpha oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mgvs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital alpha power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced alpha power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: Cognition is increasingly being recognized as an important aspect of psychotic disorders and a key contributor to functional outcome. In the past, comparative studies have been performed in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder with regard to cognitive performance, but the results have been mixed and the cognitive measures used have not always assessed the cognitive deficits found to be specific to psychosis. A set of optimized cognitive paradigms designed by the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for Schizophrenia (CNTRACS) Consortium to assess deficits specific to schizophrenia was used to measure cognition in a large group of individuals with schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder. Method: A total of 519 participants (188 with schizophrenia, 63 with schizo-affective disorder and 268 controls) were administered three cognitive paradigms assessing the domains of goal maintenance in working memory, relational encoding and retrieval in episodic memory and visual integration. Results: Across the three domains, the results showed no major quantitative differences between patient groups, with both groups uniformly performing worse than healthy subjects. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggests that, with regard to deficits in cognition, considered a major aspect of psychotic disorder, schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder do not demonstrate major significant distinctions. These results have important implications for our understanding of the nosological structure of major psychopathology, providing evidence consistent with the hypothesis that there is no natural distinction between cognitive functioning in schizophrenia and schizo-affective disorder.

AB  - Purpose. Visual hallucinations (VHs) occur in macular degeneration patients with poor vision but normal cognitive function. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the identification of pharmaceutical agents that enhance VH and use these agents to examine the contribution of retinal neurons to this syndrome. Methods. We detail clinical observations on VH in five macular degeneration patients treated with proton pump inhibitors having the core structure, 2-pyridyl-methylsulfinyl-benzimidazole. We tested possible retinal mechanisms using paired whole cell recordings to examine effects of these compounds on feedback interactions between horizontal cells and cones in amphibian retina. Results. Five patients with advanced wet macular degeneration described patterned VHs that were induced or enhanced by oral proton pump inhibitors. The abnormal images increased with light, disappeared in the dark, and originated in the retina, based on ophthalmodynamometry. Simultaneous paired whole cell recordings from amphibian cones and horizontal cells showed that 2-pyridyl-methylsulfinyl-benzimidazoles blocked the negative shift in voltage dependence and increase in amplitude of the calcium current (ICa) in cones that is induced by changes in horizontal cell membrane potential. These effects disrupt the negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones that is important for the formation of center-surround receptive fields in bipolar and ganglion cells, and thus for normal spatial and chromatic perception. Conclusions. Our study suggests that changes in the output of retinal neurons caused by disturbances in outer retinal feedback mechanisms can enhance patterned visual hallucinations. <c2><a9> 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

In particular, participants were asked to remember specific single (e.g., word, colour) or multiple features (e.g., coloured words) of experimental items with central (coloured word) vs. peripheral (a coloured frame) attributes in a working memory binding task. Performance of the patients was significantly inferior to that of controls, especially when required to remember the peripheral combination of multiple features. Results suggest that patients with schizophrenia may have difficulties in unitizing peripheral features in working memory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) may overlap in etiology and phenomenology but differ with regard to emotional processing. We used facial affect as a probe for emotional processing to determine whether there are diagnosis-related differences between SZ and BD in the function of the underlying neural circuitry. Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published up to 30 April 2012 investigating facial affect processing in patients with SZ or BD were identified through computerized and manual literature searches. Activation foci from 29 studies encompassing 483 healthy individuals, 268 patients with SZ and 267 patients with BD were subjected to voxel-based quantitative meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). Results: Compared to healthy individuals, when emotional facial stimuli were contrasted to neutral stimuli, patients with BD showed overactivation within the parahippocampus/amygdala and thalamus and reduced engagement within the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) whereas patients with SZ showed underactivation throughout the entire facial affect processing network and increased activation in visual processing regions within the cuneus. Patients with BD showed greater thalamic engagement compared to patients with SZ; in the reverse comparison, patients with SZ showed greater engagement in posterior associative visual cortices. Conclusions: During facial affect processing, patients with BD show overactivation in subcortical regions and underactivation in prefrontal regions of the facial affect processing network, consistent with the notion of reduced emotional regulation. By contrast, overactivation within visual processing regions coupled with reduced engagement of facial affect processing regions points to abnormal visual integration as the core underlying deficit in SZ.

AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia show decreased sensitivity towards clinical and experimental painful conditions. To date, the exact underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. One method to examine central integrative processes of pain perception is the thermal grill illusion (TGI), in which interlacing cold and warm bars create the illusion of a painful sensation. Methods: In 18 unmedicated patients with acute paranoid schizophrenia, cold and heat pain thresholds (CPT/HPT) as well as the perception of the TGI were examined and compared to 18 matched controls. In addition, symptom scales were obtained in order to relate pain perception to psychopathology. Results: CPT and HPT were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. In the range of TGI stimuli that were perceived painful by controls, patients did not indicate painful sensations, instead the stimulus response curve of TGI pain perception was shifted towards higher stimulus intensities, i.e., greater temperature differentials between cold and warm bars. This increase was comparable to that seen in CPT and HPT. There was no association with psychopathology for any pain parameter. Conclusions: CPT and HPT, as well as temperature differentials for the perception of the TGI were increased in patients with schizophrenia as compared to controls. Similar to visual illusions, in which reduced contrast sensitivity has been shown to alter the perception of illusions, the discriminatory somatosensory deficit, which is reflected in higher CPT and HPT as well as the previously reported increased warmth perception thresholds, might account for the attenuation of TGI in patients.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated eye movement abnormalities during smooth pursuit and antisaccadic tasks in schizophrenia. However, eye movements have not been investigated during reading. The purpose of this study was to determine whether schizophrenic subjects and their nonsymptomatic first-degree relatives show eye movement abnormalities during reading. Reading rate, number of saccades per line, amplitudes of saccades, percentage regressions (reverse saccades), and fixation durations were measured using an eye tracker (EyeLink, SensoMotoric Instruments, Germany) in 38 schizophrenic volunteers, 14 nonaffected first-degree relatives, and 57 control volunteers matched for age and National Adult Reading Test scores. Parameters were examined when volunteers read full pages of text and text was limited to progressively smaller viewing areas around the point of fixation using a gaze-contingent window. Schizophrenic volunteers showed significantly slower reading rates (P = .004), increase in total number of saccades (P <= .001), and a decrease in saccadic amplitude (P = .025) while reading. Relatives showed a significant increase in total number of saccades (P = .013) and decrease in saccadic amplitude (P = .020). Limitation of parafoveal information by reducing the amount of visible characters did not change the reading rate of schizophrenics but controls showed a significant decrease in reading rate with reduced parafoveal information (P < .001). Eye movement abnormalities during reading of schizophrenic volunteers and their first-degree relatives suggest that visual integration of foveal and parafoveal information may be reduced in schizophrenia. Reading abnormalities in relatives suggest a genetic influence in reading ability in schizophrenia and rule out confounding effects of medication.

AB  - Contour integration (CI) refers to the process that represents spatially separated elements as a unified edge or closed shape. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, inappropriate affect, and social withdrawal. Persons with schizophrenia are impaired at CI, but the specific mechanisms underlying the deficit are still not clear. Here, we explored the hypothesis that poor patient performance owes to reduced feedback or impaired longer-range lateral connectivity within early visual cortex-functionally similar to that found in 5- to 6-year old children. This hypothesis predicts that as target element spacing increases from .7 to 1.4degree of visual angle, patient impairments will become more pronounced. As a test of the prediction, 25 healthy controls and 36 clinically stable, asymptomatic persons with schizophrenia completed a CI task that involved determining whether a subset of Gabor elements formed a leftward or rightward pointing shape. Adjacent shape elements were spaced at either .7 or 1.4degree of visual angle. Difficulty in each spacing condition depended on the number of noise elements present. Patients performed worse than controls overall, both groups performed worse with the larger spacing, and the magnitude of the between-group difference was not amplified at the larger spacing. These results show that CI deficits in schizophrenia cannot be explained in terms of a reduced spatial range of integration, at least not when the shape elements are spaced within 1.5degree. Later-developing, low-level integrative mechanisms of lateral connectivity and feedback appear not to be differentially impaired in the illness.

AB  - Lateral interactions in the outer retina, particularly negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones and direct feed-forward input from horizontal cells to bipolar cells, play a number of important roles in early visual processing, such as generating center-surround receptive fields that enhance spatial discrimination. These circuits may also contribute to post-receptoral light adaptation and the generation of color opponency. In this review, we examine the contributions of horizontal cell feedback and feed-forward pathways to early visual processing. We begin by reviewing the properties of bipolar cell receptive fields, especially with respect to modulation of the bipolar receptive field surround by the ambient light level and to the contribution of horizontal cells to the surround. We then review evidence for and against three proposed mechanisms for negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones: 1) GABA release by horizontal cells, 2) ephaptic modulation of the cone pedicle membrane potential generated by currents flowing through hemigap junctions in horizontal cell dendrites, and 3) modulation of cone calcium currents (I(Ca)) by changes in synaptic cleft proton levels. We also consider evidence for the presence of direct horizontal cell feed-forward input to bipolar cells and discuss a possible role for GABA at this synapse. We summarize proposed functions of horizontal cell feedback and feed-forward pathways. Finally, we examine the mechanisms and functions of two other forms of lateral interaction in the outer retina: negative feedback from horizontal cells to rods and positive feedback from horizontal cells to cones.

AB  - The goal of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for Schizophrenia (CNTRACS) Consortium was to develop measures of discrete cognitive processes, allowing for the interpretation of specific deficits that could be linked to specific neural systems. Here we report on the intertask, clinical, and functional correlates of the 4 tasks that were investigated in large groups of patients with schizophrenia (>100) and healthy controls (>73) at 5 sites across the United States. In both healthy and patient groups, the key dependent measures from the CNTRACS tasks were minimally intercorrelated, suggesting that they are measuring discrete abilities. Correlations were examined between CNTRACS tasks and measures of functional capacity, premorbid IQ, symptom severity, and level of community functioning. Performance on tasks measuring relational memory encoding, goal maintenance, and visual gain control were correlated with premorbid IQ and the former 2 tasks with the functional capacity. Goal maintenance task performance was negatively correlated with negative symptom severity and informant reports of community function. These correlations reflect the relationship of specific abilities with functional outcome. They are somewhat lower than functional outcome correlations observed with conventional neuropsychological tests that confound multiple cognitive and motivational deficits. The measures of visual integration and gain control were not significantly correlated with clinical symptoms or function. These results suggest that the CNTRACS tasks measure discrete cognitive abilities, some of which relate to aspects of functional capacity/outcome in schizophrenia.

AB  - The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative highlighted a contour integration test as a promising index of visual integration impairment because of its well-established psychometric properties; its prior validation in healthy adults, patients, and nonhuman primates; and its potential sensitivity to treatment effects. In this multisite study, our goals were to validate the task on the largest subject sample to date, clarify the task conditions and number of trials that best discriminate patients from controls, and determine whether this discrimination can occur in standard clinical trial settings. For our task, subjects briefly observed a field of disconnected, oriented elements and attempted to decide whether a subset of those elements formed a leftward- or rightward-pointing shape. Difficulty depended on the amount of orientational jitter that was added to the shape's elements. Two versions of this Jittered Orientation Visual Integration task (JOVI) were examined. Study 1 did not reveal between-group differences in threshold (ie, the jitter magnitude needed to reach a performance level of ~80%), but this likely owed to the wide sampling distribution of jitter levels and resulting floor/ceiling effects in many conditions. Study 2 incorporated a narrower range of difficulty levels and revealed lower thresholds (worse performance) among patients (p < .001). This group difference remained even when only the first half of the trials was analyzed (p = .001). Thus, the JOVI-2 provides a brief, sensitive measure of visual integration deficits in schizophrenia. Neural implications and potential future applications of the JOVI are discussed.

AB  - The sixth meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) focused on selecting promising imaging paradigms for each of the cognitive constructs selected in the first CNTRICS meeting. In the domain of perception, the 2 constructs of interest were "gain control" and "visual integration." CNTRICS received 6 task nominations for imaging paradigms for gain control and 3 task nominations for integration. The breakout group for perception evaluated the degree to which each of these tasks met prespecified criteria. For gain control, the breakout group believed that one task (mismatch negativity) was already mature and was being incorporated into multisite clinical trials. The breakout group recommended that 1 visual task (steady-state visual evoked potentials to magnocellular-vs parvocellular-biased stimuli) and 2 auditory measures (an event-related potential (ERP) measure of corollary discharge and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) version of prepulse inhibition of startle) be adapted for use in clinical trials in schizophrenia research. For visual integration, the breakout group recommended that fMRI and ERP versions of a contour integration test and an fMRI version of a coherent motion test be adapted for use in clinical trials. This manuscript describes the ways in which each of these tasks met the criteria used in the breakout group to evaluate and recommend tasks for further development.

AB  - Abnormalities in visual processing have been found consistently in schizophrenia patients, including deficits in early visual processing, perceptual organization, and facial emotion recognition. There is however no consensus as to whether these abnormalities represent heritable illness traits and what their contribution is to psychopathology. Fifty patients with schizophrenia, 61 of their first-degree healthy relatives, and 50 psychiatrically healthy volunteers were tested with regard to facial affect (FA) discrimination and susceptibility to develop the color-contingent illusion [the McCollough Effect (ME)]. Both patients and relatives demonstrated significantly lower accuracy in FA discrimination compared with controls. There was also a significant effect of familiarity: Participants from the same families had more similar accuracy scores than those who belonged to different families. Experiments with the ME showed that schizophrenia patients required longer time to develop the illusion than relatives and controls, which indicated poor visual adaptation in schizophrenia. Relatives were marginally slower than controls. There was no significant association between the measures of FA discrimination accuracy and ME in any of the participant groups. Facial emotion discrimination was associated with the degree of interpersonal problems, as measured by the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire in relatives and healthy volunteers, whereas the ME was associated with the perceptual-cognitive symptoms of schizotypy and positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Our results support the heritability of FA discrimination deficits as a trait and indicate visual adaptation abnormalities in schizophrenia, which are symptom related.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia (SCH) is primarily a cognitive dysfunction. Its specific cognitive impairment profile was identified and suggestions have been made to include it in present diagnostic instruments as a special differential diagnostic criterion. However, studies indicate a substantial overlap of cognitive deficits between SCH patients and those with depression (DEP). In order to elucidate the structure of cognitive functioning in both entities, principal cognitive domains of SCH and DEP patients were assessed in the acute phase of disease. Subjects and methods: 44 SCH and 30 DEP patients, matched according to age, gender, education, IQ score, and duration of hospitalization were included. Neurocognitive assessments were performed in the first week of hospitalization using Digit Span test (working memory, attention). Trail Making Test (psychomotor speed, sustained attention, shifting), Rey's Complex Figure Test and Verbal Learning Test (perceptual organization, visual and verbal learning and memory). Results were evaluated according to demographically matched test norms. For statistics Student's t tests were used. Results: In both study groups deficits in maintenance and shifting of attention during psychomotor tasks were found, while automatic processes (working memory, sustained attention) were preserved. In both groups memory and learning processes were impaired, in DEP however, deficits in attention shifting during cognitive tasks and delayed recall of visual material were more intense. Conclusions: In the acute phase of schizophrenia and depression similar cognitive impairment profiles can be found. Further studies are needed to assess longitudinal dynamics and possible later development of specific patterns of cognitive functioning in these patients.

AB  - Introduction: High rates of psychopathology and worse performance in cognitive areas have been described in high risk (HR) first degree relatives of subjects with schizophrenia. The present study aimed to examine clinical and neuropsychological characteristics in two different groups of first degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia-one of siblings (HRs), and one of offspring (HRo)-and compare them with healthy controls (HC). Methods: Participants were 30 HRo, 26 HRs and 33 HC, all aged between 7 and 16 years. Clinical and neuropsychological assessments were completed by all participants. Results: No significant differences were observed between HR groups in DSM-IV diagnoses. The most prevalent diagnosis in both HR samples was attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) followed by oppositional defiant disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Both HR groups obtained worse scores than HC on prodromal symptoms, premorbid adjustment and behavioral problem scales. In cognitive areas, HRo performed worse than HC on most WISC-IV index scores, logical memory, visual memory and perceptual organization, whereas HRs only performed worse in WISC-IV indexes, logical memory and perceptual organization. Most of these differences remained stable after controlling for ADHD. The comparison between HRo and HRs showed significant differences in prodromal symptoms and working memory after controlling for ADHD. Conclusion: Similar abnormalities in HRo and HRs were found in relation to clinical and neuropsychological variables. Subtle differences were found between HR groups with HRo showing difficulties in more clinical and neuropsychological areas than HRs and HC. This suggests that, the specific kind of family relationship should to be taken into account in future HR research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual illusions allow for strong tests of perceptual functioning. Perceptual impairments can produce superior task performance on certain tasks (ie, more veridical perception), thereby avoiding generalized deficit confounds while tapping mechanisms that are largely outside of conscious control. Using a task based on the Ebbinghaus illusion, a perceptual phenomenon where the perceived size of a central target object is affected by the size of surrounding inducers, we tested hypotheses related to visual integration in deaf (n = 31) and hearing (n = 34) patients with schizophrenia. In past studies, psychiatrically healthy samples displayed increased visual integration relative to schizophrenia samples and thus were less able to correctly judge target sizes. Deafness, and especially the use of sign language, leads to heightened sensitivity to peripheral visual cues and increased sensitivity to visual context. Therefore, relative to hearing subjects, deaf subjects were expected to display increased context sensitivity (ie, a more normal illusion effect as evidenced by a decreased ability to correctly judge central target sizes). Confirming the hypothesis, deaf signers were significantly more sensitive to the illusion than nonsigning hearing patients. Moreover, an earlier age of sign language acquisition, higher levels of linguistic ability, and shorter illness duration were significantly related to increased context sensitivity. As predicted, disorganization was associated with reduced context sensitivity for all subjects. The primary implications of these data are that perceptual organization impairment in schizophrenia is plastic and that it is related to a broader failure in coordinating cognitive activity.

AB  - Perceptual organization (PO) refers to the processes by which visual information is structured into coherent patterns such as groups, contours, perceptual wholes, and object representations. Impairments in PO have been demonstrated in schizophrenia since the 1960s and have been linked to several illness-related factors including poor premorbid functioning, poor prognosis, and disorganized symptoms. This literature was last reviewed in 2005. Since then, electrophysiological (electroencephalographic, event-related potential, and magnetoencephalographic) and fMRI studies in both patient and nonpatient samples have clarified brain mechanisms involved in the impairment, and additional behavioral studies in patients and nonpatients have clarified the computational mechanisms. In addition, data now exist on the functional consequences of PO impairments, in terms of secondary difficulties in face processing, selective attention, working memory, and social cognition. Preliminary data on drug effects on PO and on changes in response to treatment suggest that anomalies in PO may furnish a biomarker for the integrity of its associated biological mechanisms. All of this recent evidence allows for a clearer picture of the nature of the impairment and how it relates to broader aspects of brain and behavioral functioning in schizophrenia.

AB  - This theme section on vision science and schizophrenia research demonstrates that our understanding of the disorder could be significantly accelerated by a greater adoption of the methods of vision science. In this introduction, we briefly describe what vision science is, how it has advanced our understanding of schizophrenia, and what challenges and opportunities lay ahead regarding schizophrenia research. We then summarize the articles that follow. These include reviews of abnormal form perception (perceptual organization and backward masking) and motion processing, and an article on reduced size contrast illusions experienced by hearing but not deaf persons with schizophrenia. These articles reveal that the methods of basic vision research can provide insights into a number of aspects of the disorder, including pathophysiology, development, cognition, social cognition, and phenomenology. Importantly, studies of visual processing in schizophrenia make it clear that there are impairments in the functioning of basic neural mechanisms (eg, center-surround modulation, contextual modulation of feedforward processing, reentrant processing) that are found throughout the cortex and that are operative in multiple forms of cognitive dysfunction in the illness. Such evidence allows for an updated view of schizophrenia as a condition involving generalized failures in neural network formation and maintenance, as opposed to a primary failure in a higher level factor (eg, cognitive control) that accounts for all other types of perceptual and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, studies of vision in schizophrenia can identify sensitive probes of neural functioning that can be used as biomarkers of treatment response.

AB  - Background: A feeling of presence (FP), that is, the vivid sensation that somebody (distinct from oneself) is present nearby, is commonly reported by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but its phenomenology has not been described precisely. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed description of FP in PD and to discuss its possible mechanisms. Patients and Methods: The authors studied 52 nondemented PD patients reporting FP in the preceding month (38 consecutive outpatients and 14 inpatients). FP characteristics were recorded with a structured questionnaire. The outpatients with FP were compared with 78 consecutive outpatients without FP. Results: About half the patients said they recognised the 'identity' of the presence. More than 75% of patients said the FP were not distressing, were short-lasting, were felt beside and/or behind the patient, and occurred while indoors; most patients checked for a real presence, but their insight was generally preserved. In 31% of cases, the patients had an unformed visual hallucination simultaneously with the FP. A higher daily levodopa-equivalent dose and the presence of visual illusions or hallucinations were independently associated with FP. Discussion: Although FP is not a sensory perception, projection of the sensation into the extrapersonal space, along with the frequent co-occurrence of elementary visual hallucinations and the strong association with visual hallucinations or illusions, supports its hallucinatory nature. FP may be viewed as a 'social' hallucination, involving an area or network specifically activated when a living being is present, independently of any perceptual clue.

AB  - Comparing the phenomenology, neurochemical pathology, and psychopharmacology of hallucinations and dreaming is limited by the available data. Evidence to date reveals no simple correspondence between the two states. Differences in the phenomenology of visual hallucinations and the visual component of dreams may reflect variations in visual context acting on the same underlying mechanism - the minimal visual input during dreaming contrasts with the more substantial perceived context in hallucinations. Variations in cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter function during sleep and during hallucinations in Lewy body dementias, together with relevant drug effects suggest that, on the whole, different, potentially opposite, changes characterise the two states. A similar analysis of other psychotic features in Lewy body dementia and other disorders suggests that, in contrast to hallucinations, there may be more convincing parallels between dreaming and delusional states.

AB  - The human visual system is comprised of an array of complex organs, which jointly decode information from visible light to construct a meaningful representation of the surrounding environment. The study of visual scanpaths transpired in a bid to enhance our understanding of the role of eye movements underpinning adaptive functioning as well as psychopathology and was further aided by the advent of modern eye-tracking techniques. This review provides a background to the nature of visual scanpaths, followed by an overview and critique of eye movement studies in specific clinical populations involving the psychotic, anxiety, and mood disorders, and concludes with suggested directions for future research. We performed a Medline and PsycInfo literature search, based on variations of the terms "visual scanpath," "eye-tracking," and "eye movements," in relation to articles published from 1986 to the present. Eye-tracking studies in schizophrenia mostly concurred with the existence of a "restricted" scanning strategy, characterized by fewer number of fixations of increased durations, with shorter scanpath lengths, and a marked avoidance of salient features, especially in relation to facial emotion perception. This has been interpreted as likely reflecting dual impairments in configural processing as well as gestalt perception. Findings from the anxiety and mood disorders have conversely failed to yield coherent results, with further research warranted to provide corroborating evidence and overcome identified methodological limitations. Future studies should also look toward applying similar techniques to related disorders as well as conducting parallel neuroimaging investigations to elucidate potential neurobiological correlates. <c2><a9> 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Horizontal cells mediate inhibitory feedforward and feedback lateral interactions in the outer retina at photoreceptor terminals and bipolar cell dendrites; however, the mechanisms that underlie synaptic transmission from mammalian horizontal cells are poorly understood. The localization of a vesicular gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (VGAT) to horizontal cell processes in primate and rodent retinae suggested that mammalian horizontal cells release transmitter in a vesicular manner. Toward determining whether the molecular machinery for vesicular transmitter release is present in horizontal cells, we investigated the expression of SNAP25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa), a key SNARE protein, by immunocytochemistry with cell type-specific markers in the retinae of mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey. Different commercial antibodies to SNAP25 were tested on vertical sections of retina. We report the robust expression of SNAP25 in both plexiform layers. Double labeling with SNAP25 and calbindin antibodies demonstrated that horizontal cell processes and their endings in photoreceptor triad synapses were strongly labeled for both proteins in mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey retinae. Double labeling with parvalbumin antibodies in monkey retina verified SNAP25 immunoreactivity in all horizontal cells. Pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy in rabbit retina confirmed expression of SNAP25 in lateral elements within photoreceptor triad synapses. The SNAP25 immunoreactivity in the plexiform layers and outer nuclear layer fell into at least three patterns depending on the antibody, suggesting a differential distribution of SNAP25 isoforms. The presence of SNAP25a and SNAP25b isoforms in mouse retina was established by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. SNAP25 expression in mammalian horizontal cells along with other SNARE proteins is consistent with vesicular exocytosis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As stimulus size increases, motion direction of high-contrast patterns becomes increasingly harder to perceive. This counterintuitive behavioral result, termed "spatial suppression," is hypothesized to reflect center-surround antagonism-a receptive field property ubiquitous in sensory systems. Prior research proposed that spatial suppression of motion signals is a direct correlate of center-surround antagonism within cortical area MT. Here, we investigated whether human MT/V5 is indeed causally involved in spatial suppression of motion signals. The key assumption is that a disruption of neural mechanisms that play a critical role in spatial suppression could allow these normally suppressed motion signals to reach perceptual awareness. Thus, our hypothesis was that a disruption of MT/V5 should weaken spatial suppression and, consequently, improve motion perception of large, moving patterns. To disrupt MT/V5, we used offline 1 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-a method that temporarily attenuates normal functioning of the targeted cortex. Early visual areas were also targeted as a control site. The results supported our hypotheses and showed that disruption of MT/V5 improved motion discrimination of large, moving stimuli, presumably by weakening surround suppression strength. This effect was specific to MT/V5 stimulation and contralaterally presented stimuli. Evidently, the critical neural constraints limiting motion perception of large, high-contrast stimuli involve MT/V5. Additionally, our findings mimic spatial suppression deficits that are observed in several patient populations and implicate impaired MT/V5 processes as likely neural correlates for the reported perceptual abnormalities in the elderly, patients with schizophrenia and those with a history of depression.

AB  - We explore the mechanisms sub-tending the re-organization and memorization of visual information by studying how these mechanisms fail in patients with schizophrenia. Several studies have suggested that patients have difficulties in organizing information in perception and memory. We explore to what extent prompting patients to group items influences memory performance. We distinguish automatic grouping from top-down grouping processes, which are especially involved in re-organizing information. The main task was to memorize pairs of figures. Following manipulation of proximity, pairs of figures were part of the same perceptual group (within-group pair, formed on the basis of automatic grouping) or belonged to different groups (between-group pairs, re-grouped through top-down processes). Prior to the memory task, subjects ran a perception task prompting them to prioritize either within-group or between-group pairs. Unlike patients, controls globally benefited from grouping by proximity in the memory task. In addition, the results showed that prioritizing between-group pairs had a deleterious effect in patients, but with a large decrement in memory performance in the case of within-group rather than between-group figures. This occurred despite preserved focalization on within-group figures, as shown by eye-movement recordings. The suggestion is that when patients are prompted to re-group separate items, they can do so, but the benefit derived from automatic grouping is then not only lost but also reversed. This suggests re-organizing visual information not only involves re-grouping separate items but also integrating these new groups in a unified representation, which is impaired in patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Disturbance in the integration of visual information is one of the hallmarks of schizophrenia. In the spatial domain, visual integration is compromised, resulting in impaired perceptual grouping and contour integration. In the time domain, in contrast, visual integration is enhanced, as manifested by increased backward masking and lower ability of patients to detect successively presented visual stimuli as asynchronous. There is much evidence that integrative processes in the brain are supported by dynamic synchronization, or phase-locking, of neural firing. In particular, synchrony in the gamma band (> 30 Hz) has been related to local visual information binding whereas synchrony in lower frequencies has been linked to global-scale integration. We recorded EEG signals evoked by steady-state gamma-frequency (40 Hz) photic stimulation in order to directly test the phase-locking of neural responses in schizophrenia. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients showed higher phase-locking of early evoked activity in the gamma band (36-44 Hz) over the posterior cortex, but lower phase-locking in theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-24 Hz) frequencies over the anterior cortex. Phase-locking of evoked responses separated schizophrenia and control subjects with accuracy of 86%. This result suggests that schizophrenia is associated with an enhanced early low-level integration in the visual cortex but a deficient high-level integration of visual information within the brain global workspace.

AB  - Context: Perceptual closure is the ability to identify objects based on partial information and depends on the function of a distributed network of brain regions that include the dorsal and the ventral visual streams, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus. Objective: To evaluate network-level interactions during perceptual closure in schizophrenia using parallel event-related potential (ERP), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and neuropsychological assessment. Design: Case-control study. Setting: Inpatient and outpatient facilities associated with the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research. Patients: Twenty-seven patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 23 healthy controls. Intervention: Event-related potentials were obtained from 24 patients and 20 healthy volunteers in response to fragmented (closeable) and control-scrambled (noncloseable) line drawings. Functional MRI was performed in 11 patients and 12 controls. Main Outcome Measure: Patterns of between-group differences for predefined ERP components and fMRI regions of interest were determined using both analysis of variance and structural equation modeling. Global neuropsychological performance was assessed using standard neuropsychological batteries. Results: Patients showed impaired generation of event-related components reflecting early sensory and later closure-related activity. In fMRI, patients showed impaired activation of the dorsal and ventral visual regions, PFC, and hippocampus. Impaired activation of dorsal stream visual regions contributed significantly to impaired PFC activation, which contributed significantly to impaired activation of the hippocampus and ventral visual stream. Impaired ventral stream and hippocampal activation contributed significantly to deficits on neuropsychological measures of perceptual organization. Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with severe activation deficits across a distributed network of sensory and higher order cognitive regions. Deficit in early visual processing within the dorsal visual stream contributes significantly to impaired frontal activation, which, in turn, leads to dysregulation of the hippocampus and ventral visual stream. Dysfunction within this network underlies deficits in more traditional neurocognitive measures, supporting distributed models of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Past studies of perceptual organization in schizophrenia have demonstrated impairments binding fragmented stimulus components into unified representations. ERP and fMRI data indicate that even under conditions of adequate behavioral task performance, significant and meaningful changes in cortical and subcortical activation are present. Here, we examined, using fMRI, activation differences on a visual task wherein feature grouping was a precursor to the formation of distinct groups in the service of target location and identification. Method: Fourteen schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy controls completed a target detection task with 2 conditions: one in which target-distractor grouping facilitates detection (the Isolated condition) and one in which it hinders detection (the Embedded condition). Stimuli were blocked by condition. Accuracy and RT data were obtained in addition to fMRI data. Results: Patients and controls did not differ significantly in accuracy or RT in either condition. Within this context, controls demonstrated greater recruitment of brain regions involved in visual-spatial processing, and the groups differed in activity in areas known to support visual search, visual analysis, decision making and response generation. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with past data indicating reduced processing of stimulus organization, and the subsequent use of inefficient visual search strategies, even under conditions when behavioral performance is at a high level and matches that of healthy controls.

AB  - New criteria for Parkinson's disease-associated psychosis (PDAP) were recently proposed by a NINDS-NIMH working group. We assessed 116 consecutive unselected outpatients with PD for the existence of psychotic symptoms during the previous month, using a structured questionnaire covering the whole spectrum of PDAP symptoms. Hallucinations occurred in 42% of the patients (visual: 16%; nonvisual: 35%), delusions in 4%, and minor symptoms in 45% (sense of presence, visual illusions, or passage hallucinations). The prevalence of PDAP was 43% when the usual definition was used (hallucinations and/or delusions) and 60% when the NINDS-NIHM criteria were used. Correlations between PDAP and patient characteristics varied with the definition of PDAP. These findings suggest that the epidemiology of PDAP should be re-evaluated with the new criteria. Minor symptoms and nonvisual hallucinations are an important part of the PDAP spectrum, which has commonly been restricted to visual hallucinations and delusions. <c2><a9> 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Recent findings indicate that binding and synchronization of distributed activities are crucial for the mechanism of consciousness, and there is increased evidence that disruptions in feature binding produce disintegration of consciousness in schizophrenia. These data suggest that the disrupted binding and disintegration of consciousness could be related to dissociation, which is historically linked to Bleuler's concept of splitting in schizophrenia. In the present study we aimed to investigate relations among electroencephalogram (EEG) activities of cortical sites and used psychometric measures of positive and negative schizophrenia symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) in 58 patients with paranoid schizophrenia. The results show statistically significant Spearman correlations of the DES with cross-correlation function in nine (of 16) EEG pairs. Positive symptoms display significant Spearman correlation with mean of cross-correlation function in only one EEG pair (F4-C4). Results of the Mann-Whitney test between patients with higher (DES >= 30) and lower dissociation show statistically significant differences between the groups for cross-correlations in nine EEG pairs. The results of this study provide the first supportive evidence for a negative relationship between cross-correlation indices and symptoms of dissociation in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits may represent external markers of an underlying neural process linked with the early etiology of psychosis. As basal ganglia function plays a governing role in both movement and cognitive processes, an understanding of the relationship between these phenomena stands to inform etiologic conceptualizations of vulnerability and psychotic disorders. Methods: In this investigation, trained raters coded movement abnormalities in videotapes from structured interviews of adolescents and young adults with a prodromal risk syndrome (n = 90). The participants were administered a neuropsychological battery including measures of verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, immediate/delayed auditory memory, and an estimate of full-scale intelligence quotient. Diagnostic status was followed for a 2-year period utilizing structured clinical interviews, during which time 24 high-risk participants (26.66%) converted to an Axis I psychotic disorder. Results: Elevated dyskinetic movements in the upper-body region were correlated with deficits in domains of verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and both immediate and delayed auditory memory. Further, discriminant function analyses indicated that baseline movement abnormalities and neurocognitive deficits significantly classified those high-risk participants who would eventually convert to a psychotic disorder (72.3%). Conclusions: Results support a common cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuit irregularity, underlying both movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits in individuals at high risk for psychosis. Models incorporating external markers of progressive basal ganglia dysfunction may enhance detection and preventive intervention for those high-risk individuals most in need of treatment.

AB  - The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain essentially unknown. The GABA hypothesis proposes that reduced neuronal GABA concentration and neurotransmission results in cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, few in vivo studies have directly examined this hypothesis. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high field to measure visual cortical GABA levels in 13 subjects with schizophrenia and 13 demographically matched healthy control subjects. We found that the schizophrenia group had an ~10% reduction in GABA concentration. We further tested the GABA hypothesis by examining the relationship between visual cortical GABA levels and orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS), a behavioral measure of visual inhibition thought to be dependent on GABAergic synaptic transmission. Previous work has shown that subjects with schizophrenia exhibit reduced OSSS of contrast discrimination (Yoon et al., 2009). For subjects with both MRS and OSSS data (n = 16), we found a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.76) between these variables. GABA concentration was not correlated with overall contrast discrimination performance for stimuli without a surround (r = -0.10). These results suggest that a neocortical GABA deficit in subjects with schizophrenia leads to impaired cortical inhibition and that GABAergic synaptic transmission in visual cortex plays a critical role in OSSS.

AB  - Introduction: Sustained and elaborative emotional information processing in depression and decreased affective elaboration in schizophrenia are considered hallmarks of these disorders but have not been directly measured. Gamma-band (35-45Hz) EEG has been associated with semantic functions such as feature binding and may index these elaborative processing. This study examined whether there were group differences in baseline and sustained gamma-band EEG following emotional stimuli in healthy adults as well as adults with depression and schizophrenia. Methods: 24 never-depressed healthy controls, 14 patients with DSM-IV unipolar major depressive disorder, and 15 patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia completed a lexical emotion identification task during EEG assessment. Gamma-band (35-45Hz) EEG in response to negative words was the primary dependent measure. Results: As predicted, depressed individuals displayed sustained and increased gamma-band EEG throughout the task, and particularly in the seconds following negative words. Individuals with schizophrenia displayed decreased gamma-band activity throughout the task. Conclusions: These data suggest that gamma-band EEG, measured over several seconds, may serve as a useful index of sustained semantic information processing. Depressed individuals appear to engage in sustained elaboration following emotional stimuli, whereas individuals with schizophrenia are not as prone to this type of elaborative processing.

AB  - Aims: Long-term use of methamphetamine could induce psychosis, but consequences with regards to intelligence have seldom been investigated. Long-term use of alcohol could also result in intellectual deterioration. Methods: The IQ of 34 methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MIP) patients (age, 28.7 +/- 6.1 years) and 34 alcohol-dependent (AD) patients (age, 40.7 +/- 7.3 years) was compared using the Chinese version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III). Results: The average full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, performance IQ, verbal comprehension index, working memory index, perceptual organization index, and processing speed index was 82.3 +/- 10.8, 84.3 +/- 11.9, 81.9 +/- 12.1, 85.5 +/- 11.9, 84.7 +/- 12.5, 85.4 +/- 13.6, and 78.5 +/- 12.7 in MIP patients and 90.5 +/- 12.0, 95.2 +/- 11.3, 86.0 +/- 13.7, 95.5 +/- 11.0, 87.1 +/- 14.5, 96.2 +/- 13.1, and 84.5 +/- 15.0 in AD patients, respectively. There were six MIP patients (17.6%) whose full-scale IQ was <70 and 13 (38.2%) whose full-scale IQ was <85 and >70, while one AD patient had a full-scale IQ <70 (2.9%) and 10 (22%) had full-scale IQ <85 and >70. Conclusions: Long-term use of methamphetamine can result not only in psychosis, but also in mentality deterioration. Intelligence deterioration is more severe in clinical MIP patients than AD patients. Assessment of the mentality of MIP patients is suggested to help with the implementation of rehabilitative programs for these patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Efforts to identify differential or core cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been made for several decades, with limited success. Part of the difficulty in establishing a cognitive profile in schizophrenia is the considerable inter-patient heterogeneity in the level of cognitive impairment. Thus, it may be useful to examine the presence of relative cognitive weaknesses on an intra-person level. In the present study we examined the rates of significant intra-person differences between crystallized verbal ability versus five other cognitive abilities among 127 persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 127 demographically matched normal comparison (NC) subjects. We found that the rates of significant discrepancies above the NC group base-rates was significantly greater in reference to those discrepancies involving visual memory relative to those associated with auditory memory, working memory, processing speed, and perceptual organization. The findings conflict with prior suggestions that working memory or auditory episodic memory are differential or core deficits in schizophrenia, and highlight the importance of considering visual memory in characterizing the cognitive effects of this condition.

AB  - When non-psychiatric individuals compare the weights of two similar objects of identical mass, but of different sizes, the smaller object is often perceived as substantially heavier. This size-weight illusion (SWI) is thought to be generated by a violation of the common expectation that the large object will be heavier, possibly via a mismatch between an efference copy of the movement and the actual sensory feedback received. As previous research suggests that patients with schizophrenia have deficits in forward model/efference copy mechanisms, we hypothesized that schizophrenic patients would show a reduced SWI. The current study compared the strength of the SWI in schizophrenic patients to matched non-psychiatric participants; weight discrimination for same-sized objects was also assessed. We found a reduced SWI for schizophrenic patients, which resulted in better (more veridical) weight discrimination performance on illusion trials compared to non-psychiatric individuals. This difference in the strength of the SWI persisted when groups were matched for weight discrimination performance. The current findings are consistent with a dysfunctional forward model mechanism in this population. Future studies to elucidate the locus of this impairment using variations on the current study are also proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: People with schizophrenia demonstrate perceptual organization impairments, and these are thought to contribute to their face processing difficulties. Method: We examined the neural substrates of emotionally neutral face processing in schizophrenia by investigating neural activity under three stimulus conditions: faces characterized by the full spectrum of spatial frequencies, faces with low spatial frequency information removed [high spatial frequency (HSF) condition], and faces with high spatial frequency information removed [low spatial frequency (LSF) condition]. Face perception in the HSF condition is more reliant on local feature processing whereas perception in the LSF condition requires greater reliance on global form processing. Past studies of perceptual organization in schizophrenia indicate that patients perform relatively more poorly with degraded stimuli but also that, when global information is absent, patients may perform better than controls because of their relatively increased ability to initially process individual features. Therefore, we hypothesized that people with schizophrenia (n=14) would demonstrate greater face processing difficulties than controls (n=13) in the LSF condition, whereas they would demonstrate a smaller difference or superior performance in the HSF condition. Results: In a gender-discrimination task, behavioral data indicated high levels of accuracy for both groups, with a trend toward an interaction involving higher patient performance in the HSF condition and poorer patient performance in the LSF condition. Patients demonstrated greater activity in the fusiform gyrus compared to controls in both degraded conditions. Conclusions: These data suggest that impairments in basic integration abilities may be compensated for by relatively increased activity in this region.

AB  - Psychotic symptoms are frequent and disabling in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methodological issues in the epidemiology of PD associated psychosis (PDP) include differences in the symptoms assessed, the methods of assessment, and the selection of patients. Most studies are prospective clinic-based cross-sectional studies providing point prevalence rates in samples on dopaminergic treatment. Visual hallucinations are present in about one quarter to one third of the patients, auditory in up to 20%. Tactile/somatic, and olfactory hallucinations are usually not systematically sought. Minor phenomena such as sense of presence and visual illusions affect 17 to 72% of the patients, and delusions about 5%. Lifetime prevalence of visual hallucinations reaches approximately 50%. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies suggest that hallucinations persist and worsen in individual patients, and that their prevalence increases with time. A facilitating role of treatment on PDP is demonstrated at least for dopaminergic agonists, but there is no simple dose-effect relationship between dopaminergic treatment and the presence or severity of hallucinations. The main endogenous non-modifiable risk factor is cognitive impairment. Other associated factors include older age/ longer duration of PD, disease severity, altered dream phenomena, daytime somnolence, and possibly depression and dysautonomia. PDP reduces quality of life in patients and increases caregiver distress, and is an independent risk factor for nursing home placement and development of dementia.

AB  - Objective: Fronto-limbic interactions facilitate the generation of task-relevant responses while inhibiting interference from emotionally distracting information. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in both executive attention and affective regulation. This study aims to elucidate the neural correlates of emotion-attention regulation and shifting in schizophrenia. Method: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe the fronto-limbic regions in 16 adults with schizophrenia and 13 matched adults with no history of psychiatric illness. Subjects performed a forced-choice visual oddball task where they detected infrequent target circles embedded in a series of infrequent non target aversive and neutral pictures and frequent squares. Results: In control participants, target events activated a dorsal frontoparietal network, whereas these regions were deactivated by aversive stimuli. Conversely, ventral fronto-limbic brain regions were activated by aversive stimuli and deactivated by target events. In the patient group, regional hemodynamic time courses revealed not only reduced activation to target and aversive events in dorsal executive and ventral limbic regions, respectively, but also reduced deactivation to target and aversive stimuli in ventral and dorsal regions, respectively, relative to the control group. Patients further showed reduced spatial extent of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus during the target and aversive conditions. Activation of the anterior cingulate to aversive images was inversely related to severity of avolition and anhedonia symptoms in the schizophrenia group. Conclusions: These results suggest both frontal and limbic dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as aberrant reciprocal inhibitions between these regions during attention-emotion modulation in this disorder.

AB  - Studies commonly report poor performance in psychotic patients compared with controls on tasks testing a range of cognitive functions, but, because current IQ is often not matched between these groups, it is difficult to determine whether this represents a generalized deficit or specific abnormalities. Fifty-three first-episode psychosis patients and 53 healthy controls, one-to-one matched for sex, age, and full-scale current IQ, were compared on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) subtests representing indices of perceptual organization, verbal comprehension, processing speed, and working memory as well as other tests of executive function and episodic memory. The groups showed an equivalent pattern of performance on all WAIS subtests except digit symbol processing speed, on which the patients were significantly worse. Patients were also worse on measures where performance correlated with digit symbol score, namely working and verbal memory tasks. Standardized residual scores for each subtest were calculated for each patient using the difference between their actual subtest score and a predicted subtest score based on their full-scale IQ and the performance of controls. Scaled scores and residual scores were examined for relationships with clinical measures. Digit symbol-scaled score was significantly correlated with concurrent negative syndrome score at baseline, and digit symbol residual score significantly predicted residual negative symptoms at 1-year follow-up. In summary, our comparison of patients and controls precisely matched for IQ revealed that processing speed was attenuated in recent-onset schizophrenia, contributed significantly to working and episodic memory deficits, and was a prognostic factor for poor outcome at 1 year.

AB  - Recent studies of autism and schizophrenia examining the factor structure of the subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised have identified a factor that is thought to assess social cognitive (SC) processes or social context. The objective of the current study was to determine whether a similar factor could be identified using confirmatory factor analysis of the 14 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) subtests in the standardization sample. A five-factor model that included an SC factor along with verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory, and processing speed factors provided the best fit of the data. The SC factor was composed of the Picture Arrangement, Picture Completion, and Object Assembly subtests when all 14 WAIS-III subtests were included. These results provide support for the construct validity of SC factors measured by the WAIS-III in the standardization sample, although additional research is necessary to determine its stability across age groups and clinical populations, as well as its sensitivity to various forms of brain dysfunction.

AB  - Context: Visual masking procedures assess the earliest stages of visual processing. Patients with schizophrenia reliably show deficits on visual masking, and these procedures have been used to explore vulnerability to schizophrenia, probe underlying neural circuits, and help explain functional outcome. Objective: To identify and compare regional brain activity associated with one form of visual masking (ie, backward masking) in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. Design: Subjects received functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. While in the scanner, subjects performed a backward masking task and were given 3 functional localizer activation scans to identify early visual processing regions of interest (ROIs). Setting: University of California, Los Angeles, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. Participants: Nineteen patients with schizophrenia and 19 healthy control subjects. Main Outcome Measure: The magnitude of the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal during backward masking. Results: Two ROIs (lateral occipital complex [LO] and the human motion selective cortex [hMT+]) showed sensitivity to the effects of masking, meaning that signal in these areas increased as the target became more visible. Patients had lower activation than controls in LO across all levels of visibility but did not differ in other visual processing ROIs. Using whole-brain analyses, we also identified areas outside the ROIs that were sensitive to masking effects (including bilateral inferior parietal lobe and thalamus), but groups did not differ in signal magnitude in these areas. Conclusions: The study results support a key role in LO for visual masking, consistent with previous studies in healthy controls. The current results indicate that patients fail to activate LO to the same extent as controls during visual processing regardless of stimulus visibility, suggesting a neural basis for the visual masking deficit, and possibly other visual integration deficits, in schizophrenia.

AB  - Deficits in early visual processing are well documented in schizophrenia, using methods such as contrast sensitivity. Higher, integrative stages of functioning, such as susceptibility to visual illusions, have been evaluated less extensively. For example, patients show increased susceptibility to (ie, are more easily affected by) the Muller-Lyer illusion but decreased susceptibility (ie, are less easily affected by) to stereopsis based upon binocular disparity. The basis for pattern of illusion response and interaction between sensory and integrative stages of processing, however, is unclear. We tested a group of 38 patients and 28 control subjects in contrast sensitivity, the Muller-Lyer and Poggendorff illusions, as well as a subgroup in stereopsis and the Ponzo illusion, Sander parallelogram, and Hermann grid illusions. We predicted that patients would be more susceptible to tests that become more apparent with increased contrast (Muller-Lyer illusion), less susceptible to tests that become less apparent with increased contrast (stereopsis, Ponzo illusion, Hermann grid), and equally susceptible to contrast-insensitive tests (Poggendorff illusion). Additionally, the Hermann grid was tested at varying levels of contrast. Patients demonstrated significant deficits in contrast sensitivity, especially to brief, low spatial frequency stimuli, and the predicted differential response to the tested illusions. Additionally, poor performance on stereopsis and the Hermann grid significantly correlated with decreased contrast sensitivity (all P's<.01). Muller-Lyer illusion and stereopsis performance were also inversely related (P<.01). This study replicates and expands upon previous findings with visual illusions. Our results offer a unifying explanation for disparate studies and suggest that deficits in early sensory gain affect subsequent integrative processes.

The global-local task is a measure of attention and perceptual organization that utilizes visual stimuli comprised of large letters (global level) made up of smaller letters (local level). Subjects identify target letters appearing at either the global or local level of the stimulus. In this study, we used a version of the global-local task specifically designed to examine lateralized hemispheric processing and attention shifting in 30 schizophrenia patients and 24 normal controls. Global-local stimuli were presented in couplets (consecutive pairs). Reaction time for the second target in a couplet was compared under conditions in which the target remained at the same level (global-global, local-local) and when the target changed levels (global-local, local-global). Level-specific priming (ie, global to global and local to local) and the local-to-global level shift were similar in both groups. Schizophrenia patients were significantly slower, however, shifting attention from the global to the local level. These results implicate an impairment in shifting attentional resources from predominantly right lateralized magnocellular/dorsal stream processing of global targets to predominantly left lateralized parvocellular/ventral stream processing of local targets. Local interference effects in global processing provide further support for impaired magnocellular processing in schizophrenia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual perception of a stimulus is a function of the visual context in which it is displayed. Surround suppression is a specific form of contextual modulation whereby the perceived contrast of a center stimulus is decreased by a high-contrast surround. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia are less prone to visual contextual effects, suggesting impairments in cortical lateral connectivity. We tested whether altered contextual modulation in schizophrenia is stimulus orientation selective. Participants viewed an annulus consisting of contrast-reversing sinusoidal gratings and determined if any one segment of the annulus had lower contrast relative to the other segments. Three stimulus configurations were tested: no surround (NS), parallel surround (PS), and orthogonal surround (OS). In the PS condition, the annulus was embedded in a 100% contrast grating parallel to the annulus gratings. In the OS condition, the surround grating was rotated 90degree relative to the orientation of the annulus gratings. The main dependent measure was the suppression index-the change in contrast threshold in the OS and PS conditions relative to the NS condition. There was a group x condition interaction such that patients had significantly lower PS suppression index than controls, but there were no group differences in the OS suppression index. We conclude that individuals with schizophrenia possess an abnormality in surround suppression that is specific for stimulus orientation. In conjunction with physiological and anatomical evidence from basic and postmortem studies, our results suggest a deficit of inhibition in primary visual cortex in schizophrenia.

AB  - Behavioral and electrophysiological studies of schizophrenia have consistently demonstrated impairments in the integration of visual features into unified perceptual representations. Specific brain regions involved in this dysfunction, however, remain to be clarified. This study used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine the relative involvement of visual cortex areas (involved in form perception) and parietal and frontal regions (involved in attention), in the visual integration impairment in schizophrenia. Fourteen patients with schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls were compared on behavioral performance and data acquired via fMRI while completing a contour integration task that had previously been used to identify a visual integration deficit in schizophrenia. The schizophrenia patients demonstrated poorer visual integration than controls. Analyses of peak signal change indicated that while the groups were equivalent in area V1, the schizophrenia group demonstrated reduced signal in areas V2-V4, which are the earliest regions sensitive to global configurations of stimuli. Moreover, whereas the control group demonstrated greater recruitment of prefrontal and parietal areas during perception of integrated forms compared to random stimuli, the schizophrenia group demonstrated greater recruitment of frontal regions during perception of random stimuli. The two groups differed on brain regions involved in form perception even when they were matched on accuracy levels. The visual integration disturbance in schizophrenia involves both deficient basic visual processes (beginning as early as occipital region V2), as well as reduced feedback from visual attention regions that normally serves to amplify relevant visual representations relative to irrelevant information. <c2><a9> Imperial College Press.

AB  - Focusing primarily on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this article reviews evidence regarding the roles of subregions of the medial temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex, posterior representational areas, and parietal cortex in source memory. In addition to evidence from standard episodic memory tasks assessing accuracy for neutral information, the article considers studies assessing the qualitative characteristics of memories, the encoding and remembering of emotional information, and false memories, as well as evidence from populations that show disrupted source memory (older adults, individuals with depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or schizophrenia). Although there is still substantial work to be done, fMRI is advancing understanding of source memory and highlighting unresolved issues. A continued 2-way interaction between cognitive theory, as illustrated by the source monitoring framework (M. K. Johnson, S. Hashtroudi, & D. S. Lindsay, 1993), and evidence from cognitive neuroimaging studies should clarify conceptualization of cognitive processes (e.g., feature binding, retrieval, monitoring), prior knowledge (e.g., semantics, schemas), and specific features (e.g., perceptual and emotional information) and of how they combine to create true and false memories.

AB  - Patients suffering from schizophrenia are less susceptible to various visual illusions. For example, healthy participants perceive a hollow mask as a normal face, presumably due to the strength of constraining top-down influences, while patients with schizophrenia do not (Schneider, U., Leweke, F.M., Sternemann, U., Weber, M.M., Emrich, H.M., 1996. Visual 3D illusion: a systems-theoretical approach to psychosis. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 246, 256-260; Scheider, U., Borsutzky, M., Seifert, J., Leweke, F.M., Huber, T.J., Rollnik J.D., Emrich, H.M., 2002. Reduced binocular depth inversion in schizophrenic patients. Schizophrenia Research 53, 101-108.; Emrich, H.M., Leweke, F.M., Schneider, U., 1997. Towards a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia: cognitive impairments due to a dysregulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 56, 803-807). However the neural mechanisms underpinning this effect remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the hollow-mask illusion in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The primary aim of this study was to use measures of effective connectivity arising from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to explain differences in both the perception of the hollow-mask illusion and associated differences in neural responses between patients with schizophrenia and controls, which we hypothesised would be associated with difference in the influences of top-down and bottom-up processes between the groups. Consistent with this explanation, we identified differences between the two groups in effective connectivity. In particular, there was a strengthening of bottom-up processes, and weakening of top-down ones, during the presentation of 'hollow' faces for the patients. In contrast, the controls exhibited a strengthening of top-down processes when perceiving the same stimuli. These findings suggest that schizophrenic patients rely on stimulus-driven processing and are less able to employ conceptually-driven top-down strategies during perception, where incoming sensory data are constrained with reference to a generative model that entails stored information from past experience.

AB  - The third meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) focused on selecting promising measures for each of the cognitive constructs selected in the first CNTRICS meeting. In the domain of perception, the 2 constructs of interest were gain control and visual integration. CNTRICS received 5 task nominations for gain control and three task nominations for visual integration. The breakout group for perception evaluated the degree to which each of these tasks met prespecified criteria. For gain control, the breakout group for perception believed that 2 of the tasks (prepulse inhibition of startle and mismatch negativity) were already mature and in the process of being incorporated into multisite clinical trials. However, the breakout group recommended that steady-state visual evoked potentials be combined with contrast sensitivity to magnocellular vs parvocellular biased stimuli and that this combined task and the contrast-contrast effect task be recommended for translation for use in clinical trial contexts in schizophrenia research. For visual integration, the breakout group recommended the Contour Integration and Coherent Motion tasks for translation for use in clinical trials. This manuscript describes the ways in which each of these tasks met the criteria used by the breakout group to evaluate and recommend tasks for further development.

AB  - Objectives: In a recent pilot RCT, looking at the efficacy of body oriented psychological therapy (BPT) in patients with chronic schizophrenia, a marked improvement in negative symptoms was found in the treatment group. To date, there have been no studies to evaluate the therapeutic processes, correlates and predictors of change in-patients receiving BPT. The aims of this study are to address three specific questions, namely how: (1) Ego-pathology and (2) Body experiences, may change during the treatment (BPT). We also looked at: (3) If these pathologies, and/or changes in them, or other characteristics are associated with specific clinical outcomes. Design: Analysis of data obtained within a pilot randomized controlled trial. Method: In a sample of patients with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia, allocated to receive a course of body oriented group psychotherapy, certain parameters were assessed pre- and post-treatment: (1) Ego-pathology, using the ego-pathology inventory (EPI); (2) Body experiences, (size perception/image marking procedure-IMP, body image/body distortion questionnaire-BDQ, and body cathexis/visual-analogue-scales-VAS); and (3) Common symptom factors, using the Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Subjective experiences were also recorded. Results: Four out of six ego-pathology symptom scores improved over the course of therapy (t = 2.9-3.5, p < .05-.01). Amongst the measures of body experiences, only the body perception indices of the lower extremities changed significantly from underestimation pre-therapy (BPI median 92.3), becoming accurate estimates post therapy (BPI median 101.1). Contrary to the hypothesis a reduction of negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients was not associated with systematic improvements of ego-pathology or body experiences. The strongest predictor of change was a high score of ego-demarcation pre-treatment (beta = 0:89, p < .001). Conclusions: In patients with chronic schizophrenia, body oriented psychological interventions may be effective for both positive therapeutic changes in ego-pathology and negative symptoms, even though these effects are not necessarily related. High scores of ego-pathology at baseline predicted a poor treatment outcome. This finding deserves more systematic studies, as it could potentially identify patients with poorer prognosis and underpin the development of new intervention strategies. Further studies are required to clarify more precisely the exact nature of the processes in BPT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study frames anomalous functional brain organization in schizophrenia (SCZ) within an evolutionary model of brain development, the dual trends theory (DTT). The DTT argues that neural architecture develops along 2 separate pathways: the dorsal archicortical trend and the ventral paleocortical trend. The DTT dovetails with visual system organization, which is also composed of 2 independent pathways: a dorsal stream dedicated to visuomotor action and a ventral stream dedicated to perceptual processing. The present study examined the integrity of these pathways using a size-contrast visual illusion. Prior research has shown that, normally, perceptual estimations of object size are susceptible to visual illusions, whereas goal-directed actions are resistant. The authors hypothesized that, unlike control participants, SCZ patients' actions would be susceptible to the illusion, reflecting dorsal stream dysfunction. Here, 42 SCZ patients and 42 healthy controls grasped and estimated the size of target blocks in control and illusion conditions. During estimation, both groups were equally perturbed by the illusion; however, grasping movements of patients alone were influenced by the illusion. These results suggest disrupted dorsal brain circuitry in SCZ but relatively intact ventral circuitry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study investigated whether impaired visual attention among patients with schizophrenia can be accounted for by poor perceptual organization and impaired search selectivity. Twenty-three patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy control participants completed a conjunctive visual search task where the relative frequency of the two types of distractors was manipulated. It has been shown that, when the total number of items in a display is fixed, search performance depends on the relative frequency of the types of distractors (i.e., as the ratio becomes more discrepant search time decreases). This modulation of search efficiency reflects participants' ability to group items by their perceptual similarity and then search only the smaller group of items that share a feature with the target. Results show that patients modulate their response time normally as a function of the distractor ratio--that is, they benefit from the presence of a smaller distractor subset in the display. This suggests that patients with schizophrenia, group items according to their perceptual similarity and flexibly deploy their attention to the smaller subset of distractors on each trial. These results demonstrate that search selectivity as a function of the relative frequency of distractors is unimpaired among patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Neural oscillations and their synchronization may represent a versatile signal to realize flexible communication within and between cortical areas. By now, there is extensive evidence to suggest that cognitive functions depending on coordination of distributed neural responses, such as perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, subsystem integration, working memory, and consciousness, are associated with synchronized oscillatory activity in the theta-, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-band, suggesting a functional mechanism of neural oscillations in cortical networks. In addition to their role in normal brain functioning, there is increasing evidence that altered oscillatory activity may be associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, that involve dysfunctional cognition and behavior. In the following article, we aim to summarize the evidence on the role of neural oscillations during normal brain functioning and their relationship to cognitive processes. In the second part, we review research that has examined oscillatory activity during cognitive and behavioral tasks in schizophrenia. These studies suggest that schizophrenia involves abnormal oscillations and synchrony that are related to cognitive dysfunctions and some of the symptoms of the disorder. Perspectives for future research will be discussed in relationship to methodological issues, the utility of neural oscillations as a biomarker, and the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia.

AB  - Apparent motion (AM), the Gestalt perception of motion in the absence of physical motion, was used to study perceptual organization and neurocognitive binding in schizophrenia. Associations between AM perception and psychopathology as well as meaningful subgroups were sought. Circular and stroboscopic AM stimuli were presented to 68 schizophrenia spectrum patients and healthy participants. Psychopathology was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Psychopathology was related to AM perception differentially: Positive and disorganization symptoms were linked to reduced gestalt stability; negative symptoms, excitement and depression had opposite regression weights. Dimensions of psychopathology thus have opposing effects on gestalt perception. It was generally found that AM perception was closely associated with psychopathology. No difference existed between patients and controls, but two latent classes were found. Class A members who had low levels of AM stability made up the majority of inpatients and control subjects; such participants were generally young and male, with short reaction times. Class B typically contained outpatients and some control subjects; participants in class B were older and showed longer reaction times. Hence AM perceptual dysfunctions are not specific for schizophrenia, yet AM may be a promising stage marker. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Humans have a special ability to recognize human faces that transcends and is separate from the usual discrimination abilities of the visual system. Schizophrenia patients are known to have an impaired ability to recognize facial affect, a deficit that may stem from a more profound problem of face identification and perception. The special skill of detecting human faces relies upon numerous capabilities, including gestalt perception, "filling-in", and proper gaze scanning, facilities that recent research has shown to be deficient in schizophrenia patients. We therefore hypothesized that schizophrenia patients have a deficit in their perception and structural analysis of human faces that will manifest in their difficulty in detecting faces hidden within neutral pictures. We tested the ability of 35 schizophrenia patients and 32 healthy controls at detecting hidden human faces and animals or animal faces hidden within eight pictures. Overall, the patients recognized fewer items compared to controls, however, it was specifically the human faces in which this difference was significant, suggesting that schizophrenic patients have a specific deficit in their human face recognition system.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that spans across biological and behavioral levels. The links between altered neural circuitry and abnormal behaviors are yet to be understood. Visual motion perception has been established in basic neuroscience and may provide an opportunity to link different levels of brain functions in schizophrenia. Center-surround interaction is a ubiquitous neural mechanism underlying the organization of visual information over different spatial locations. Methods: We applied a psychophysical paradigm to examine center-surround interaction in schizophrenia. Patients (n = 24) and control subjects (n = 33) judged the direction of a moving random dot pattern (RDP, center) with and without the presence of another concentric surrounding RDP (surround). Results: The presence of a moving surround shifted the perceptual judgments of center motion in the opposite direction from the surround in both subject groups but the magnitude of the perceptual shift was significantly larger in patients. The increased perceptual shift was not correlated with psychotic symptoms, which were mild in this patient sample, or antipsychotic medication. Conclusions: The increased perceptual shift suggests that the putative surround suppression on visual motion perception is abnormally increased in schizophrenia. This result provides perceptual evidence for altered basic inhibitory control of visual motion context in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - If disturbance of binding in long term memory is well established in schizophrenia, data concerning working memory maintenance are less clear. Feature binding in working memory was investigated in 19 patients with schizophrenia and 19 healthy controls. Binding was assessed by comparing two conditions in which participants had to retain four letters and four spatial locations. These features were presented either bound or separate. Results showed that both groups had better performances for bound than separate features, despite the fact that patients performed significantly worse than controls. When maintenance for isolated features was assessed, patients were severely disturbed for spatial locations but not for letters. Such a result suggests that reduced working memory performance in patients with schizophrenia for bound features is probably a consequence of a spatial deficit rather than a specific deficit of the binding process. Thus, not all form of binding are disturbed in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - From phenomenological and experimental perspectives, research in schizophrenia has emphasized deficits in "higher" cognitive functions, including attention, executive function, as well as memory. In contrast, general consensus has viewed dysfunctions in basic perceptual processes to be relatively unimportant in the explanation of more complex aspects of the disorder, including changes in self-experience and the development of symptoms such as delusions. We present evidence from phenomenology and cognitive neuroscience that changes in the perceptual field in schizophrenia may represent a core impairment. After introducing the phenomenological approach to perception (Husserl, the Gestalt School), we discuss the views of Paul Matussek, Klaus Conrad, Ludwig Binswanger, and Wolfgang Blankenburg on perception in schizophrenia. These 4 psychiatrists describe changes in perception and automatic processes that are related to the altered experience of self. The altered self-experience, in turn, may be responsible for the emergence of delusions. The phenomenological data are compatible with current research that conceptualizes dysfunctions in perceptual processing as a deficit in the ability to combine stimulus elements into coherent object representations. Relationships of deficits in perceptual organization to cognitive and social dysfunction as well as the possible neurobiological mechanisms are discussed.

AB  - Context: The use of endophenotypes, biological traits that increase the liability to a disorder, represents one strategy to facilitate the detection of susceptibility genes for complex behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia. Establishing that a candidate trait is both heritable and linked genetically to schizophrenia is integral to its validity as an endophenotypic marker. Neurocognitive deficits are among the most promising indicators of increased risk for schizophrenia; however, it is not clear to what extent these deficits are genetically linked to the disorder. Objectives: To quantify the genetic and environmental contributions to the variability of selected neurocognitive measures and to estimate the genetic relationship between these and schizophrenia. Design: Genetic model fitting to monozygotic and dizygotic twin data. Setting: United Kingdom psychiatric research institute. Participants: Two hundred sixty-seven monozygotic and dizygotic twins concordant and discordant for schizophrenia, and healthy monozygotic and dizygotic control twin pairs. Main Outcome Measures: The heritabilities of intelligence, working memory, processing speed, perceptual organization, and verbal comprehension were estimated, and the genetic relationship between each of these and schizophrenia was quantified. Results: Genetic influences contributed substantially to all of the cognitive domains, but intelligence and working memory were the most heritable. A significant correlation was found between intelligence and schizophrenia (r = -0.61; 95% confidence interval, -0.71 to -0.48), with shared genetic variance accounting for 92% of the covariance between the two. Genetic influences also explained most of the covariance between working memory and schizophrenia. Significant but lesser portions of covariance between the other cognitive domains and schizophrenia were also found to be genetically shared. Environmental effects, although separately linked to neurocognition and schizophrenia, did not generally contribute to their covariance. Conclusion: Genomewide searches using factorial designs stratifying for levels of intelligence and working memory will assist in the search for finding quantitative trait loci for schizophrenia.

AB  - Perceptual organization represents a basic and essential function that occurs at an intermediate level of visual processing. Much of the previous research on perceptual organization in schizophrenia employed indirect measurements, or included factors beyond sensory processing. The aims of the present study were to determine the integrity of perceptual organization in schizophrenia, as well as to determine the stimulus duration necessary to perform perceptual organization. Psychophysical measurements were compared between patients with schizophrenia and matched control subjects. Participants viewed dot patterns briefly presented on a computer monitor, and indicated whether stimuli appeared grouped as vertical or horizontal lines. Grouping was based upon either relative proximity or similarity in color. Across trials, relative proximity or color similarity was progressively reduced until stimuli became bi-stable (perceived as either of two patterns of grouping), establishing the grouping threshold. In separate conditions, stimuli were immediately followed by a mask to limit processing. Stimulus duration was progressively reduced until stimuli became bi-stable, establishing the critical stimulus duration (CSD). Schizophrenia patients demonstrated elevated grouping thresholds for grouping by proximity as well as color similarity. In addition, CSD was significantly extended for the schizophrenia group, with a nearly four-fold increase in duration of processing. These results provide direct evidence of impairment in schizophrenia for perceptual organization based upon spatial relationships and feature similarity, and suggest deficits in low-level perceptual organization processes. Although this study did not directly investigate the physiological correlates underlying perceptual impairments, these results are consistent with a theory of impaired lateral connections within visual cortical areas in schizophrenia.

AB  - Although impairment in flexibility of abstract thought has been linked to poor insight in schizophrenia, little is known about the association of other cognitive processes to insight. To explore the possibility that social cognition and perceptual organizational capacity are linked to insight, we assessed awareness of illness and administered the Thematic Apperception Test and Rorschach Inkblot Test to 31 adult participants with schizophrenia. Partial correlations controlling for perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test revealed that lesser capacities to organize and make sense of ambiguous stimuli, to distinguish between one's own and other's perspectives, and to formulate logical accounts of behavior and social exchange predicted poorer awareness of psychiatric symptoms. With replication, results may suggest that to attain awareness of illness, some with schizophrenia may need assistance making sense of the social world and organizing the complexities of their experience of illness.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the construct validity of the special four-factor structure of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Chinese version in a clinical sample of inpatients with schizophrenia as well as a sample of healthy adults. A sample of 114 inpatients with schizophrenia and a sample of 114 close-matched non-clinical adults on the Chinese mainland were studied with the measures of the WAIS-III Chinese version. Four competing hypothetical models of factors were tested for model fit and parsimony in both research samples, using maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a four-factor model of Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Working Memory, and Processing Speed best fit the data from both the schizophrenia sample and the healthy adult sample, and also fitted the data from both samples better than alternative models, which is similar to that reported by the developers and revisers of this scale. These empiric analyses and results support the construct validity of the WAIS-III Chinese version in patients with schizophrenia and healthy adults on the Chinese mainland.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists such as ketamine can induce transient schizophrenia-like symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions in healthy volunteers similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia. Perceptual organization deficits have been documented in schizophrenia and are thought to be related to some symptoms associated with the illness. The current study was designed to determine whether people who repeatedly self-administer ketamine would also show deficits in perceptual organization. Using a psychophysically well-controlled measure of contour integration, we compared a group of recreational users (n=16) to a group of poly-drug using controls (n=16). Contour integration performance was measured on the night of drug use and 3 days later when drug free. The results showed that on the night of drug use, ketamine produced a dysfunction in contour integration however, this was not present 3 days later when drug free. Levels of dissociation were also higher in ketamine users only on the night of drug use. These preliminary data provide some support for the role of NMDA-receptor hypofunctioning in dysfunctional coordination of cognitive activity.

AB  - Social cognition has received increasing attention in schizophrenia due to its theoretical relevance to core features of the disorder as well as the marked deficits in social functioning exhibited by these patients. However, there remains a need to develop and validate measures of social cognitive abilities and to demonstrate that they are constructs that are separable from non-social neurocognitive processes. In the current study, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) was administered to 169 males with schizophrenia, and test results were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to determine if those WAIS-R subtests containing social content would form a distinct Social Cognition (SC) factor. CFA was used to evaluate various models that hypothesized an SC factor, and for comparison purposes the same models were evaluated in the WAIS-R standardization sample. Results confirmed the presence of a four-factor model that included an SC factor, as well as the more commonly reported Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, and Working Memory factors. The SC factor consisted of the Picture Arrangement and Picture Completion subtests, and demonstrated small but significant correlations with disorganization and negative symptoms, as well as with an index of social functioning. Results provide support for the validity of the SC factor as a measure of social cognition in schizophrenia, and demonstrate that at least some aspects of social cognition represent separable cognitive domains in schizophrenia.

AB  - Pervasive deficits of attention and set switching have been reported in schizophrenia, prompting efforts to identify the information processing mechanisms associated with these deficits. Recent evidence suggests that set switching may be intact in schizophrenia when the task switch requires only a change in the relevance of perceptual dimensions (e.g., attentional set switches) but decision-to-response mappings (intentional set) are maintained across trials in a cued task switching procedure. The goal of the present research was to replicate this finding and to test its direct corollary, which is the unconventional prediction that individuals with schizophrenia will evidence an intact, switch-sensitive P3b brain response to cued switches of attentional set. This prediction was tested in a group of 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 20 healthy comparison participants using event-related brain potential methodology and a cued task-switching task. Attentional set switching costs were equivalent between the two groups despite a set maintenance deficit in schizophrenia. Moreover, a posterior-parietal P3b component of the ERP was found to be equally sensitive to attentional set switching in schizophrenia and comparison groups, indicating a "healthy" brain response to switches of attentional set in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the dynamic control of attentional set may be preserved in schizophrenia and that previously reported executive deficits may be specific to the control of intentional task set and to deficits of task set maintenance.

Data on of gestalt perception, visual illusions (VI), hierarchical letters (HL), Block Design (BD) and the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) were collected in adult males with HFA, schizophrenia, depression and normative controls. Individuals with HFA processed gestalt stimuli less in accord with gestalt laws, particularly regarding the principle of similarity. Gestalt processing correlated positively with global processing of the HL. EFT and BD performance correlated negatively with VI susceptibility in HFA. All clinical groups succumbed less to VI than the normative sample. Results suggest decreased gestalt perception in HFA, being associated with a more general local visual processing bias.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate both the independent and joint effects of genetic risk and clinical status on neurocognitive functioning in adolescents from a population isolate with an elevated risk for schizophrenia and strong familial aggregation of cases. Method: The subjects were 310 non-help seeking, drug-naive adolescents 14-19 years of age from the Republic of Palau. The sample comprised 98 Genetically High Risk (GHR) adolescents, 54 of whom were symptomatic, and 212 Genetically Low Risk (GLR) adolescents, including 113 Clinically High Risk (CHR) subjects who were symptomatic and 99 normal controls who were non-symptomatic. Neurocognitive testing was conducted after the clinical assessment and included Wechsler Memory Scale tests of logical, visual and working memory, the perceptual organization and processing speed subtests of the WISC-III, CPT-IP measures of sustained attention, and tests of fine and gross neuromotor function. Results: GHR adolescents showed impairments in immediate logical memory, verbal working memory, CPT-IP performance, and fine motor skills. The only two cognitive components influenced by the presence of early psychosis symptoms were WISC-III perceptual organization and spatial working memory. Neurocognitive deficits did not increase with increasing levels of psychopathology. We found no significant interactive effects of genetic risk and clinical status on neurocognitive functioning. Conclusions: Genetic risk and clinical status exert independent effects on neurocognitive function in HR adolescents, and genetic risk has a broader impact than clinical status. Our results suggest that many of the neurocognitive impairments associated with early psychosis are genetically mediated and can occur in genetically vulnerable individuals regardless of their clinical status. However, visuospatial processing appears to be uniquely disrupted by emerging symptomatology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: A series of studies have suggested that schizophrenia patients are deficient in theory of mind (ToM). However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying ToM deficits in schizophrenia are largely unknown. The present study examined the hypothesis that impaired ToM in schizophrenia can be understood as a deficit in context processing. Methods: Disorganised schizophrenia patients (N = 12), nondisorganised schizophrenia patients (N = 36), and nonpsychotic psychiatric patients (N = 26) were tested on three ToM tasks and a visual size perception task, a measure of perceptual context processing. In addition, statistical analyses were carried out which compared chronic, treatment-refractory schizophrenia patients (N = 28) to those with an episodic course of illness (N = 20). Results: Overall, ToM performance was linked to deficits in context processing in schizophrenia patients. Statistical comparisons showed that disorganised as well as chronic schizophrenia patients were more impaired in ToM but more accurate in a visual size perception task where perceptual context is misleading. Conclusions: This pattern of results is interpreted as indicating a possible link between deficits in ToM and perceptual context processing, which together with deficits in perceptual grouping, are part of a broader dysfunction in cognitive coordination in schizophrenia.

AB  - This study evaluated visual perceptual grouping in schizophrenia to test the hypothesis that the disorganization syndrome in schizophrenia is related to a deficit in cognitive coordination. Perceptual grouping was examined with three psychophysically well-controlled tasks in patients with disorganized schizophrenia (n = 11), non-disorganized schizophrenia (n = 24), psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia (n = 31) and non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (n = 35). These measures assessed processing of both concurrent and preceding stimulus context. Deficits in perceptual grouping were observed on all three tasks in disorganized schizophrenia patients. Dysfunctional perceptual grouping mechanisms produced both enhanced and impaired task performance suggesting that the pattern of performance observed was the result of a specific deficit in the grouping of stimulus elements. We interpret these data as further support for the hypothesis that the disorganization syndrome in schizophrenia reflects a widespread deficit in the cognitive coordination of contextually related stimuli, leading to dysfunctional grouping of stimulus features in vision, thought and language.

AB  - Schizophrenia is often accompanied by a range of visual perception deficits, with many involving impairments in motion perception. The presence of perceptual abnormalities may impair neural processes that depend on normal visual analysis, which in turn may affect overall functioning in dynamic visual environments. Here, we examine the integrity of suppressive center-surround mechanisms in motion perception of schizophrenic patients. Center-surround suppression has been implicated in a range of visual functions, including figure-ground segregation and pursuit eye movements, visual functions that are impaired in schizophrenia. In control subjects, evidence of center-surround suppression is found in a reduced ability to perceive motion of a high-contrast stimulus as its size increases. This counterintuitive finding is likely a perceptual correlate of center-surround mechanisms in cortical area MT. We now show that schizophrenic patients exhibit abnormally weak center-surround suppression in motion, an abnormality that is most pronounced in patients with severe negative symptoms. Interestingly, patients with the weakest surround suppression outperformed control subjects in motion discriminations of large high-contrast stimuli. This enhanced motion perception of large high-contrast stimuli is consistent with an MT abnormality in schizophrenia and has a potential to disrupt smooth pursuit eye movements and other visual functions that depend on unimpaired center-surround interactions in motion.

AB  - Recent theoretical and empirical research on schizophrenia converges on the notion that core aspects of the pathophysiology of the disorder may arise from a dysfunction in the coordination of distributed neural activity. Synchronization of neural responses in the beta-band (15-30 Hz) and gamma-band range (30-80 Hz) has been implicated as a possible neural substrate for dysfunctional coordination in schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we examined the electroencephalography (EEG) activity in 19 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, edition IV criteria, diagnosis of schizophrenia and 19 healthy control subjects during a Gestalt perception task. EEG data were analyzed for phase synchrony and induced spectral power as an index of neural synchronization. Schizophrenia patients were impaired significantly in the detection of images that required the grouping of stimulus elements into coherent object representations. This deficit was accompanied by longer reaction times in schizophrenia patients. Deficits in Gestalt perception in schizophrenia patients were associated with reduced phase synchrony in the beta-band (20-30 Hz), whereas induced spectral power in the gamma-band (40-70 Hz) was mainly intact. Our findings suggest that schizophrenia patients are impaired in the long-range synchronization of neural responses, which may reflect a core deficit in the coordination of neural activity and underlie the specific cognitive dysfunctions associated with the disorder.

AB  - Background: Neurologic examination abnormalities (NEA) are more prevalent among patients with schizophrenia as well as their unaffected relatives when compared with healthy controls, suggesting that NEA may be endophenotypes for schizophrenia. We estimated the heritability of NEA in moderately sized pedigrees. We also evaluated correlations between NEA and cognitive performance in order to examine their construct validity. Methods: Members of eight extended families, each consisting of two first degree relatives with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders, as well as available first- to fifth-degree relatives were examined (n = 96 participants). A modification of the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES) was employed, augmented with localizing signs. Where feasible, we used untransformed data such as error counts and completion time, rather than ordinal measures. Heritability was estimated using the variance component method, implemented in SOLAR. Results: Statistically significant heritability (h2) estimates were obtained for several measures (p < 0.05, h2 +/- standard error: rapid alternating movements, right-sided completion time, 0.99 +/- 0.19; alternating fist-palm test, completion time, 0.77 +/- 0.19 s, errors, 0.70 +/- 0.32; fist-ring test, right-sided completion time, 0.53 +/- 0.23 s, left-sided completion time, 0.70 +/- 0.21 s; go-no go task, correct responses, 0.93 +/- 0.33; audio-visual integration, correct responses, 0.79 +/- 0.54). For most items, heritability analysis was hampered by insufficient data variability (infrequent errors). Correlational analyses show some degree of divergence among types of NEA, repetitive motor tasks being associated with most domains of cognitive functioning other than executive functioning, and cognitive-perceptual tasks being associated with memory and executive functioning. Conclusions: Significant familial influences on certain aspects of neurologic performance were detected. These heritable measures were also correlated with heritable neurocognitive measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary purpose of this investigation was to assess the neural correlates of implicit cueing during an inhibitory task in schizophrenia when performance accuracy was matched with healthy comparison subjects., METHODS: We compared 17 individuals with chronic schizophrenia (SZ; medicated, 13.9 average years of illness) and 17 healthy comparison subjects (HC) matched for hit and false alarm rates, age, and education on a visual Go/Nogo task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this task, one of the go stimuli also served implicitly as a cue predictive of a subsequent inhibitory (Nogo) trial., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that even when matched for overall performance accuracy, individuals with SZ exhibit difficulties with inhibition and cue processing that may relate to core deficits in cognitive control and stimulus processing. In particular, these findings point towards an important role of the parietal cortex for cued inhibitory processes in healthy populations.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify latent factors of the most widely used scale to measure neurological soft signs, the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES), in a sample of schizophrenia patients, their relatives, and non-psychiatric controls. Method: The NES was administered following the format and instructions of the original scale [Buchanan, R.W., Heinrichs, D.W., 1989. The Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES): a structured instrument for the assessment of neurological signs in schizophrenia. Psychiatry Res. 27, 335-350]. Three factor analyses were conducted using: (1) 23 items of the scale, (2) these 23 items in a sample restricted to African American participants, and (3) 12 items previously recommended based on adequate inter-rater reliability [Sanders, R.D., Forman, S.D., Pierri, J.N., Baker, R.W., Kelley, M.E., van Kammen, D.P., Keshavan, M.S., 1998. Inter-rater reliability of the neurological examination in schizophrenia. Schizophr. Res. 29, 287-292]. Results: Exploratory factor analysis in the overall sample (n=110) revealed three factors of interest: a "coordination/Romberg" factor (which included the fist-edge-palm test, finger-thumb opposition, rapid alternating movements, and the Romberg test), a "sensory integration" factor (which included synkinesis, extinction, stereognosis, and audio-visual integration), and an "eye movements/tandem walk/overflow movements" factor (which included convergence, gaze impersistence, tandem walk, and adventitious overflow). Minimal differences were apparent when comparing these results with those obtained from an analysis including only African American participants (n = 99). Restricting the analysis to only 12 items resulted in two factors (with poor discriminant validity and internal consistency), which showed few similarities with previously reported exploratory factor analysis results. Conclusions: This study shows that results of empirically-derived factors of the NES vary substantially across study samples and research groups, though there appear to be at least two consistent latent variables, one related to the repetition of motor tasks and another tapping the processing of sensory stimuli. The factors demonstrated in the present study are more consistent with the original conceptually-derived subscales than prior factor analyses. Thus, until further research replicates consistent subscales of subtle neurological impairment in a variety of settings and samples, the total NES score may be more useful when comparing results across studies. Further research on latent neurological factors is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There is evidence that cognitive task performance breaks down into the same broad domains in schizophrenia as in healthy populations. However, this does not mean that the domains are independent of one another or that the interrelationships among domains are the same between groups. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to compare the latent structure of a broad neuropsychological battery in schizophrenia patients (n = 148) and healthy controls (n = 157). Main analyses examined the fit of a hierarchical six-factor model, in which associations among the factors were assumed to reflect their strong shared relationship to a general cognitive ability factor. The model incorporated the factors of verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, verbal memory, spatial memory, processing speed, and executive/working memory. The hierarchical model provided a good overall fit to data from both groups. However multiple groups CFA revealed significant differences in factor loadings between groups, reflecting a more generalized latent structure of cognitive ability in schizophrenia. This was also evident in higher bivariate correlations among cognitive domain composite scores calculated from the observed test data. Cognitive ability, as reflected in test performance, appears to be more unitary in schizophrenia than in healthy subjects. This finding may have measurement and treatment implications.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic schizophrenia patients have previously demonstrated performance deficits in contour integration tasks. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether schizophrenia patients, spanning a range of illness severity, would demonstrate responsiveness to manipulations that recruit top-down processing strategies involving learning and sequencing effects in a contour integration task. Methods: We administered a contour integration test over four consecutive days and in two different presentation conditions each day. In one condition, the stimuli were administered in order of increasing difficulty, and in the other they were presented in random order. The order in which these two conditions were presented was counterbalanced across days and participants. In addition, a nonschizophrenia psychotic disorders control group was included to determine if past findings of a contour integration deficit in schizophrenia could be replicated in the presence of a symptomatically similar control group. Results: All groups demonstrated similar learning curves across the four days and generally similar overall levels of performance, with the exception of the group of the most chronic schizophrenia patients. In addition, the order in which the stimuli were presented to subjects affected their performance, with higher scores achieved for all groups in the condition where the stimuli were presented in increasing order of difficulty. Interaction effects revealed that the effects of order presentation were greater for nonpatient than for psychotic patients. Conclusions: These data are further evidence that perceptual organization impairments in schizophrenia are illness severity-related, and that schizophrenia patients as a whole are less sensitive to top-down manipulations in this type of task.

AB  - Deficits in perceptual organization have been consistently reported in schizophrenia, as has an association between these deficits, disorganized symptoms, and poorer premorbid functioning and prognosis, suggesting that they may be an index of illness severity or progression. It is unclear, however, whether the impairment is present at, or before the first psychotic episode. This study examined perceptual organization in young people considered to be at high-risk for schizophrenia, defined by the "close-in" strategy [Yung, A.R., McGorry, P.D., McFarlane, C.A., Jackson, H.J., Patton, G.C., Rakkar, 1996. Monitoring and care of young people at incipient risk of psychosis. Schizophrenia Bulletin, 22, 283-303]. The high-risk group (n=70) was compared to first-episode patients (n=54), and nonpatients (n=24) using a task with known sensitivity to perceptual organization deficits in schizophrenia, and whose scores have predicted long-term outcome and disorganized symptomatology in past studies [Knight, R.A., Silverstein, S.M., 1998.

Perceptual organization of configural and nonconfigural visual patterns in schizophrenia: effects of repeated exposure. Cognitive Neuropsychiatry 3, 209-223]. There were no differences between groups, and the first-episode group demonstrated non-significantly more sensitivity to stimulus organization than the other groups. When the high-risk group was broken down into its 3 subgroups (A-family history of psychotic illness and recent drop of 30+ points in the GAF scale; B-history of attenuated psychotic symptoms; C-brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms), only group A demonstrated evidence of impairment, but this group differed significantly only from first- and young, later-episode schizophrenia patients, not from nonpatients. These findings are consistent with recent data on pre-attentive processes in schizophrenia which indicate that performance is not impaired and may even be enhanced, early in the illness, with dysfunctions beginning with increased chronicity.

AB  - Functional outcome for individuals with schizophrenia has been associated with cognitive impairment. Deficits in attention, memory, speed of information processing and problem-solving skills affect independent functioning, vocational performance, and interpersonal functioning. This study investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functioning, clinical symptoms and daily problem-solving skills in seriously and persistently ill persons. Thirty-eight inpatients and outpatients were administered a neurocognitive battery for attention, working memory, processing speed, perceptual organization, and executive functioning; and semi-structured clinical interviews using the BPRS and SANS. Estimates of daily problem-solving skills were obtained using the relevant factor subscale from the Independent Living Scales (ILS-PB). Daily problem-solving skills were significantly correlated with negative symptoms, processing speed, verbal memory, and working memory scores. A regression model using an enter method suggests that working memory and negative symptoms are significant predictors of daily problem-solving skills and account for 73.2% of the variance. Further analyses demonstrate that daily problem-solving skills and negative symptoms were significantly different for inpatients and outpatients and significantly correlated with community status. The findings suggest the ILS-PB has utility as a proxy measure for assessing real-world functioning in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cognitive impairment is well documented in schizophrenia, though some reports have been interpreted to suggest that it is possible to have schizophrenia without neuropsychological impairment. The authors tested this by comparing the neuropsychological profiles of closely matched patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparison participants. Sixty-four patients with schizophrenia and 64 healthy comparison cases, matched to within 3 Full-Scale IQ points, were tested using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997b) and the Wechsler Memory Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997c). Neuropsychological profiles for these groups were markedly different, with the group of patients with schizophrenia exhibiting performance deficits in memory and speeded visual processing but superior verbal comprehension and perceptual organization relative to the group of healthy comparison participants matched on Full-Scale IQ. Thus, scoring in the normal range does not preclude neuropsychological abnormality in schizophrenia, confirming that neuropsychological impairment is a core feature of the illness.

AB  - Objective: The authors tested whether decisions about incongruencies in the representation and processing of semantic knowledge, thought to be related to cognitive control, are selectively impaired in schizophrenia. Method: Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy comparison subjects determined the relative size of paired stimuli as they are in the real world. Stimuli were words or images. Real-world "distance" (size difference between stimuli) was manipulated within pairs, as was "congruency" between real-world and presentation size. Results: Although patients were slower overall, both groups exhibited similar effects of "distance" and "congruency"; the task was easier when the real-world size difference between stimuli was greater and when stimuli were congruent in presentation and real-world size. Conclusions: Some aspects of the representation of semantic knowledge are preserved in schizophrenia, and patients use this information to control cognition in the same manner as healthy individuals.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is associated with impaired visual information processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between anomalous perceptual experiences, positive and negative symptoms, perceptual organization, rapid categorization of natural images and magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) visual pathway functioning. Method: Thirty-five unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and 20 matched healthy control volunteers participated. Anomalous perceptual experiences were assessed with the Bonn Scale for the Assessment Basic Symptoms (BSABS). General intellectual functions were evaluated with the revised version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The 1-9 version of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was used to investigate sustained attention. The following psychophysical tests were used: detection of Gabor patches with collinear and orthogonal flankers (perceptual organization), categorization of briefly presented natural scenes (rapid visual processing), low-contrast and frequency-doubling vernier threshold (M pathway functioning), isoluminant colour vernier threshold and high spatial frequency discrimination (P pathway functioning). Results: The patients with schizophrenia were impaired on test of perceptual organization, rapid visual processing and M pathway functioning. There was a significant correlation between BSABS scores, negative symptoms, perceptual organization, rapid visual processing and M pathway functioning. Positive symptoms, IQ, CPT and P pathway measures did not correlate with these parameters. The best predictor of the BSABS score was the perceptual organization deficit. Conclusions: These results raise the possibility that multiple facets of visual information processing deficits can be explained by M pathway dysfunctions in schizophrenia, resulting in impaired attentional modulation of perceptual organization and of natural image categorization.

AB  - The research into perceptual organization in schizophrenia spectrum disorders has found evidence for and against a perceptual organization deficit and has interpreted the data from within several different theoretical frameworks. A synthesis of this evidence, however, reveals that this body of work has produced reliable evidence for deficits in schizophrenia, as well as for the clinical, stimulus, and task parameters associated with normal and abnormal performance. Recent models of cognition have also advanced understanding of the underlying pathophysiological processes of perceptual organization dysfunction in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. These suggest that deficits in perceptual organization may be one manifestation of a wider disturbance in the integration of contextually related information across space and time.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is associated with perceptual organization deficits and abnormal neuronal connectivity has been described in early visual areas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional integrity of lateral connections in early visual areas of patients with schizophrenia and type I bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis. Method: Twenty-four out-patients with schizophrenia, 22 out-patients with bipolar disorder, and 20 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Using a computer-assisted psychophysical test, contrast thresholds were measured for centrally presented target stimuli (Gabor patches), which were surrounded by two collinear flankers. Target-to-flanker distances were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12lambda. Psychophysical measures were contrast threshold changes at each target-to-flanker distance compared with baseline thresholds determined for isolated targets with no flankers. Clinical measures included IQ, positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Results: In patients with schizophrenia, flankers did not facilitate contrast detection for target stimuli at 2-6lambda distances compared to controls [effect size (Cohen's d): 1-25-1-42]. The inhibitory effect of flankers (0 and 1lambda) and contrast thresholds in the absence of flankers were spared. Patients with bipolar disorder did not differ from the controls. Medicated and non-medicated patients displayed similar performances. Positive and negative symptoms and depression did not correlate with contrast threshold values. Conclusions: Excitatory lateral connections in early visual cortex are specifically impaired in patients with schizophrenia, which may contribute to perceptual disorders such as unclear seeing, partial or skewed sight, disrupted rectilinearity, and abnormal figure-ground segregation.

AB  - A number of studies have demonstrated an increased rate of histories of childhood maltreatment among adults with serious mental illness. The present investigation documented the presence of childhood maltreatment in a sample of 40 psychiatric inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The type (neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse), duration, and severity of childhood maltreatment was examined along with measures of premorbid functioning, current symptomatology, and cognitive functioning. Participants with histories of maltreatment were significantly more likely to have poorer peer relationships in childhood, more difficulty in school, an earlier age at first hospitalization, more previous hospitalizations, elevated symptoms of anxiety, depression, and suicidality on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and more impaired performance on a task of visual-perceptual organization. Severity and frequency of childhood maltreatment were both positively correlated with hallucinations and delusions on the BPRS. Linear trend analysis indicated a pattern of more severe impairment as the number of types of maltreatment increased. No relationships were found between maltreatment and measures of executive functioning, verbal fluency, or verbal processing speed. A history of childhood maltreatment appears to be a significant determinant of premorbid functioning, illness-related symptom expression, and specific forms of cognitive dysfunction.

AB  - This study evaluated deficits in visual perceptual organization in schizophrenia over the course of inpatient treatment, in relation to the remission of particular psychotic symptoms. Disorganized (n=14) and non-disorganized (n=33) schizophrenia patients were tested upon admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit, and again after 3 weeks of treatment, on two measures of visual perceptual organization. Performance of schizophrenia patients was compared to groups of patients with psychotic disorders other than schizophrenia (n=19) and non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (n=25). Symptom ratings were collected at both assessment points. Deficits in visual perceptual organization were observed for both tasks in disorganized schizophrenia patients at index and these deficits improved during the course of treatment. Moreover, improvement in visual perceptual organization correlated significantly with reductions in disorganized symptoms in the schizophrenia group. We interpret these data as further support for the hypothesis that the disorganization syndrome in schizophrenia reflects a widespread deficit in the cognitive coordination of contextually related stimuli, leading to dysfunctional organization of stimulus features in vision, thought and language.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that high frequency power (>20Hz) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) are associated with feature binding and attention. It has been hypothesized that hallucinations and perceptual abnormalities might be linked to irregularities in fast frequency activity. This study examines the power and distribution of high frequency activity (HFA) during sleep in healthy control subjects and unmedicated patients with schizophrenia and depression. This is a post-hoc analysis of an archival database collected under identical conditions. Groups were compared using multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) using group frequency by stage analysis. A multiple regression analyzed the association between HFA power and clinical symptoms. Schizophrenic (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients showed significantly greater high frequency (HF) power than healthy controls (HC) in all sleep stages (p<0.0001). SZs also exhibited significantly greater HF power than MDD patients in all sleep stages except wakefulness (W) (p<0.05). In all groups, gamma (35-45Hz) power was greater in W, decreased during slow wave sleep (SWS) and decreased further during rapid eye movement (REM). Beta 2 (20-35 Hz) power was greater in W and REM than in SWS. Only positive symptoms exhibited an association with HF power. Elevated HFA during sleep in unmedicated patients with SZ and MDD is associated with positive symptoms of illness. It is not clear how HFA would change in relation to clinical improvement, and further study is needed to clarify the association of HFA to the state/trait characteristics of SZ and MDD.

AB  - As revealed by backward masking studies, schizophrenic patients show strong impairments of early visual processing. However, the underlying temporal mechanisms are not yet well understood. To shed light on the exact timing of these deficits, we employed a paradigm in which two masks follow each other. We investigated 16 medicated schizophrenic patients and a matched group of 14 controls with a new backward masking technique, shine-through. In accordance with other masking studies, schizophrenic patients require a dramatically longer processing time to reach a predefined performance level compared with healthy subjects. However, patients are surprisingly sensitive to subtle differences in the timing of the two masks, revealing good temporal resolution. This good temporal resolution indicates intact and fast perceptual grouping and figure-ground segmentation in spite of high susceptibility to masking procedures in schizophrenia.

AB  - We investigated the use of the Family Pictures test from the Wechsler Memory Scale III as a measure of the ability to bind the multiple features of a complex visual scene in a study group of 77 patients with schizophrenia and 44 healthy controls. Patients demonstrated impaired recall of all scene features as well as a reduction in the number of features recalled for each remembered character. Secondary analyses using patients and controls matched for character recall also showed reduced feature binding in the patient group. Such feature binding deficits likely implicate hippocampal dysfunction, consistent with neuroimaging evidence of structural and functional compromise of the medial temporal lobe in schizophrenia.

AB  - Visual context processing was examined in relation to schizotypy in a large nonclinical university population. Schizotypal status was assessed with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Schizotypal (n = 32) and non-schizotypal (n = 37) subjects were tested on a contour integration task (where context processing is necessary for good performance) and a visual size perception task (where context processing impairs accurate performance). In addition, a short form of the Thought Disorder Index (TDI) was administered to 28 schizotypal subjects. Thought disordered Schizotypal subjects showed significantly impaired performance on the contour integration task but more accurate performance on the visual size perception task. These results support the hypothesis that deficits in visual context processing are the manifestation of a larger disturbance of cognitive coordination in schizotypy and schizophrenia.

AB  - This study investigated feature binding in a working memory task in patients with schizophrenia and in normal controls. Twenty-five patients and 25 controls participated. On each trial, three drawings of familiar objects were presented sequentially, each in a different cell of a 3X3 grid. In different blocks of trials, participants remembered either individual features (object and location conditions) or an object and its location (combination condition). The results showed that patients were slower and less accurate than controls under all conditions. Accuracy of both groups was reduced in the combination condition relative to the single-feature conditions, but patients showed disproportionately poorer performance in the combination condition than in the object and location conditions. Thus, patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in working memory, particularly when the task requires binding objects to their locations. This finding demonstrates that processes that establish coherent and temporary episodic representations in working memory are impaired in schizophrenia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate lateral connectivity in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. Contrast thresholds were measured for centrally presented Gabor patches which were surrounded by two collinear or orthogonal flankers. The healthy subjects (n=15) showed lower contrast thresholds for central Gabor patches when collinear flankers were presented. This effect was significantly reduced in unmedicated highly functioning schizophrenia patients (n=20) who performed normally on the continuous performance test. The performance of the patients did not correlate with the positive and negative symptoms. The facilitation effect of collinear flankers is believed to reflect lateral interactions between feature-specific units in early visual cortex (V1). Our results therefore suggest abnormal lateral interactions in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. <c2><a9> 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The visual working memory (WM) storage capacity of patients with schizophrenia was investigated using a change detection paradigm. Participants were presented with 2, 3, 4, or 6 colored bars with testing of both single feature (color, orientation) and feature conjunction conditions. Patients performed significantly worse than controls at all set sizes but demonstrated normal feature binding. Unlike controls, patient WM capacity declined at set size 6 relative to set size 4. Impairments with subcapacity arrays suggest a deficit in task set maintenance: Greater impairment for supercapacity set sizes suggests a deficit in the ability to selectively encode information for WM storage. Thus, the WM impairment in schizophrenia appears to be a consequence of attentional deficits rather than a reduction in storage capacity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previously the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was shown to disrupt generation of the auditory event-related potential (FRP) mismatch negativity (MMN) and the performance of an AX-type continuous performance test (AX-CPT)--measures of auditory and visual context-dependent information processing--in a similar manner as observed in schizophrenia. This placebo-controlled study investigated effects of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin on the same measures in 18 healthy volunteers (10 men, 8 women; mean age 25.1 yrs). Psilocybin administration induced significant performance deficits in the AX-CPT, but failed to reduce MMN generation significantly. These results indirectly support evidence that deficient MMN generation in schizophrenia may be a relatively distinct manifestation of deficient NMDAR functioning. In contrast, secondary pharmacological effects shared by NMDAR antagonists and the 5-HT2A agonist (i.e., disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission) may be the mechanism underlying impairments in AX-CPT performance observed during both psilocybin and ketamine administration. Comparable deficits in schizophrenia may result from independent dysfunctions of 5-HT2A and NMDAR-related neurotransmission. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Integration of information provided simultaneously by audition and vision was studied in a group of 18 schizophrenic patients. They were compared to a control group, consisting of 12 normal adults of comparable age and education. By administering two tasks, each focusing on one aspect of audio-visual integration, the study could differentiate between a spatial integration deficit and a speech-based integration deficit. Experiment 1 studied audio-visual interactions in the spatial localisation of sounds. Experiment 2 investigated integration of auditory and visual speech. The schizophrenic group performed as the control group on the sound localisation task, but in the audio-visual speech task, there was an impairment in lipreading as well as a smaller impact of lipreading on auditory speech information. Combined with findings about functional and neuroanatomical specificity of intersensory integration, the data suggest that there is an integration deficit in the schizophrenic group that is related to the processing of phonetic information.

AB  - Studied 2 sets of variables expected to be related to broad ratings of community functioning (CF) in 40 outpatients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder: (1) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) index scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory (WM), and processing speed (PS); and (2) positive, negative, disorganized, and affective symptom variables. Of the WAIS-III index scores, WM and PS entered a stepwise regression, together accounting for substantial variance in CF ratings. However, only PS remained significantly associated with CF after controlling for the other indexes. In relation to CF, the remaining indexes appeared to be overlapping markers of general neurocognitive ability, rather than specific measures of discrete cognitive domains. Addition of positive and negative symptom variables in a further analysis greatly increased the explained functional variance. PS overlapped substantially with negative symptoms in predicting CF, while the other WAIS-III indexes were independent of symptoms. Results illustrate the importance of knowing which neurocognitive variables have specific relationships to functional status and which reflect the influence of more general cognitive ability in daily life.

AB  - It has been proposed that a characteristic of schizophrenic processing is an abnormality of top-down processing. The relationship between impaired top-down processing and symptoms of reality distortion was investigated using a "degraded interference' task. In this task, fragmented stimuli (Stroop words, control words and crosses) are presented on a computer screen, and the extent to which they are visually integrated is inferred by their interfering properties. It was predicted that psychotic individuals would fail to show an interference effect with degraded Stroop stimuli. This predicts the absence of a delay in reaction time in the experimental condition, which therefore cannot be attributed to a generalized deficit. A sample of inpatients experiencing positive symptoms was compared to a healthy control group. The results provided support for a deficiency in top-down processing, with the psychotic group failing to show the significant degraded interference effect found in the healthy controls. Degraded interference was associated with low verbal IQ, but with no other symptomatic or demographic variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Newer antipsychotic drugs have shown promise in ameliorating neurocognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia, but few studies have compared newer antipsychotic drugs with both clozapine and conventional agents, particularly in patients who have had suboptimal response to prior treatments. Method(s): The authors examined the effects of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on 16 measures of neurocognitive functioning in a double-blind, 14-week trial involving 101 patients. A global score was computed along with scores in four neurocognitive domains: memory, attention, motor function, and general executive and perceptual organization. Result(s): Global neurocognitive function improved with olanzapine and risperidone treatment, and these improvements were superior to those seen with haloperidol. Patients treated with olanzapine exhibited improvement in the general and attention domains but not more than that observed with other treatments. Patients treated with risperidone exhibited improvement in memory that was superior to that of both clozapine and haloperidol. Clozapine yielded improvement in motor function but not more than in other groups. Average effect sizes for change were in the small to medium range. More than half of the patients treated with olanzapine and risperidone experienced "clinically significant" improvement (changes in score of at least one-half standard deviation relative to baseline). These findings did not appear to be mediated by changes in symptoms, side effects, or blood levels of medications. Conclusion(s): Patients with a history of suboptimal response to conventional treatments may show cognitive benefits from newer antipsychotic drugs, and there may be differences between atypical antipsychotic drugs in their patterns of cognitive effects.

AB  - Right and left hemisphere contributions to perceptual organization functions were examined using a divided-attention version of the global-local task in a sample of 21 unmedicated participants diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) and 20 controls. The SPD participants showed an abnormal global processing advantage. When the visual angle of the hierarchical stimuli was increased from 3degree to 9degree, the controls showed an increasing local processing advantage, but the SPD participants continued to show an abnormal global processing advantage. These findings suggest a local processing deficit on divided-attention versions of the global-local task in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Female SPD participants, who had less severe interpersonal deficit symptoms, showed a more abnormal global processing advantage. Hemispheric and processing resource mechanisms that might explain these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the functional meaning of neurocognitive components of continuous performance tests (CPT). 30 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed CPT tasks concerning perceptual organization, selective attention, short-term memory, working memory, and vigilance-sustained attention. Psychometrically parallel versions were created within each experimental block. Results show that schizophrenia Ss exhibited specific differences regarding all levels of perceptual organization performance compared to major depressive and healthy control Ss. Three-seven CPT version performances could be explained by problems with short-term memory, sustained attention, and perceptual organization. Findings suggest that the etiology of schizophrenia may be conceptualized as a circumscribed neurocognitive deficit or a multifunctional, multilocal deficit.

AB  - Established the specificity of body image pathology in patients with schizophrenia, its changes during acute treatment, and its association with other symptom factors. Cognitive, affective, and perceptual facets of body image and psychopathology were assessed in 60 inpatients with paranoid schizophrenia, 19 with schizoaffective disorder, 40 with depressive disorder, and 28 with anxiety disorders at admission, and after 2 and 4 wks of treatment. Body size perception was also assessed in 44 healthy adults. Ss with paranoid schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders showed underestimation of lower extremities at each time point. They expressed a higher degree of body concept disturbances at admission, but not at later stages. In a factor analysis, body perception and body concept loaded on distinct factors, which were separate from positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and anxiety.

AB  - Tested the hypothesis that intramodal visual binding is disturbed in schizophrenia and should be detectable in all illness stages as a stable trait marker. Three groups totalling 29 patients (rehospitalized chronic schizophrenic, first admitted schizophrenic and schizotypal patients believed to be suffering from a pre-schizophrenic prodrome) and a group of normal control subjects (Ss) were tested on 3 tasks targeting visual binding abilities (Muller-Lyer's illusion and 2 figure detection tasks) in addition to control parameters such as reaction time, visual selective attention, Raven's test and two conventional cortical tasks of spatial working memory (SWM) and a global-local test. Chronic patients had a decreased performance on the binding tests. Unexpectedly, the prodromal group exhibited an enhanced Gestalt extraction on these tests compared both to schizophrenic patients and to healthy Ss. Furthermore, chronic schizophrenia was associated with a poor performance on cortical tests of SWM, global-local and on Raven. This association appears to be mediated by or linked to the chronicity of the illness. The initial hypothesis is rejected. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The hypothesis that the perceptual organization dysfunction of patients with poor premorbid schizophrenia is due to a deficit in global visual sensory store processing was tested by assessing their ability to process symmetrical configurations that develop early and have strong prepotent structures. Two same-different judgment tasks in which performance varies as a function of the symmetrical organization and task demands were administered to participants with good and poor premorbid schizophrenia, those with mood disorders, and normal controls. Like the other groups, poor premorbid schizophrenics' latency and error response patterns closely paralleled the a priori model of adequate processing. The results support their competence in perceptually processing symmetrical configurations and disconfirm the hypothesis that their input deficiencies represent a general deficiency in all forms of perceptual organization. The implications for specifying their early input dysfunction are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: In patients with schizophrenia, deficient generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) - An event-related potential (ERP) indexing auditory sensory ('echoic') memory - And a selective increase of 'context dependent' ('CBX') errors in the 'A-X' version of the Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) indicate an impaired ability to form and use transient memory traces. Animal and human studies implicate deficient N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functioning in such abnormalities. In this study, effects of the NMDAR antagonists ketamine on MMN generation and AX-CPT performance were investigated in healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that NMDARs are critically involved in human MMN generation, and to assess the nature of ketamine-induced deficits in AX-CPT performance. Method(s): In a single-blind placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy volunteers underwent an infusion with subanesthetic doses of ketamine. The MMN-to-pitch and MMN-to-duration deviants were obtained while subjects performed an AX-CPT. Result(s): Ketamine significantly decreased the peak amplitudes of the MMN-to-pitch and MMN-to-duration deviants by 27% and 21%, respectively. It induced performance deficits in the AX-CPT characterized by decreased hit rates and specific increases of errors (BX errors), reflecting a failure to form and use transient memory traces of task relevant information. Conclusion(s): The NMDARs are critically involved in human MMN generation. Deficient MMN in schizophrenia thus suggests deficits in NMDAR-related neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dysfunction may also contribute to the impairment of patients with schizophrenia in forming and using transient memory traces in more complex tasks, such as the AX-CPT. Thus, NMDAR-related dysfunction may underlie deficits in transient memory at different levels of information processing in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Brain mechanisms underlying deficits in precision of transient memory storage in schizophrenia were investigated using a combined behavioral and event-related potential approach. Performance was measured simultaneously in 2 tasks: an AX-type visual continuous performance test (AX-CPT), which required subjects to press a button whenever they saw a letter A followed by a letter X, and a mismatch negativity paradigm. The AX-CPT is designed to assess prefrontal function, whereas mismatch negativity assesses functioning of the auditory sensory memory system. Method(s): Subjects were 17 patients with chronic schizophrenia, 13 with recent-onset schizophrenia, and 20 normal comparison subjects. Potentials were recorded from 36 scalp locations in response to cue stimuli in the CPT and to duration- and pitch-deviant stimuli in the mismatch negativity paradigm. Behavioral measures including responses to incorrect cue-target sequences that should have been ignored ('false alarms') were analyzed as a function of cue-target interval. Result(s): Chronic and recent-onset schizophrenic patients showed significantly decreased mismatch negativity amplirude but normal latency and topography. In the CPT, patients showed significantly higher rates of false alarms following incorrect cues ('BX' errors) and decreased rates of correct detections. Impaired performance correlated with decreased frontocentral event-related potential activation to incorrect cues that was manifest within several hundred milliseconds of cue presentation. All groups performed worse with increasing cue-target intervals. Patients were no more affected by increased cue-target interval than were controls. Conclusion(s): Schizophrenic patients are significantly impaired in their ability to form and utilize transient memory traces to guide behavior. These deficits are associated with failures of cortical activation occurring within several hundred milliseconds of stimulus presentation. A similar pattern of deficit is observed across sensory and cognitive systems.

AB  - Schizophrenia patients' perceptual organization abilities were assessed with a psychophysically well-controlled measure of contour integration. Compared with psychiatric and staff controls, schizophrenia patients were less able to detect contours comprising Gabor elements as the detection of these contours relied increasingly on long-range spatial interactions. Impaired task performance was also found to correlate significantly with higher levels of disorganized symptomatology. These data provide further evidence for impaired perceptual grouping in schizophrenia. In addition, the findings support the hypothesis that a common cortical processing algorithm involving contextual coordination is impaired in schizophrenia, leading to reduced binding of object features in vision, and reduced contextual disambiguation of linguistic information during thought and speech.

AB  - Background: Previous reports document visual illusions resembling hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) after risperidone treatment in patients with histories of previous LSD exposure. Method(s): We report a case with visual disturbances resembling HPPD after each of three consecutive risperidone dose increases. Result(s): Contrasting with previous reports, our patient lacked any history of substance abuse, particularly hallucinogen exposure. She lacked neurologic or other contributory illnesses. Illusions generally remitted within 48 hours each time. Coadministration of trazodone and clonazepam may have contributed to these phenomena, although clonazepam has been used to treat this condition. She had been unusually sensitive to the side-effects of many psychotropics. Conclusion(s): This case is unique due to the absence of substance abuse. This and another report note heightened sensitivity to medication side-effects. Visual phenomena resembling HPPD evidently can occur with risperidone and, possibly, other atypical antipsychotics and certain antidepressants regardless of previous hallucinogen use. Several lines of evidence implicate reduced 5HT2a serotonin receptor stimulation rather than increased 5HT2c stimulation.

AB  - Response monitoring in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls was assessed by measuring performance and event-related brain potentials in the flanker priming task. Three visual-context conditions were construed: Flankers and targets pointed either into the same direction or into different directions. Stimuli without any response assignment were used as flankers in the neutral context condition. The schizophrenic patients were further subdivided into paranoid (n = 19) and nonparanoid (n = 10) patients and compared with healthy controls (n = 18). Performance scores revealed that the flankers induced a similar degree of distraction by visual context in all 3 groups. Although the schizophrenic patients showed normal error correction performance, the error negativity (NE) was significantly reduced in paranoid schizophrenic patients. The attenuation of the NE possibly reflects disturbed response monitoring in these patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Right and left hemisphere hypotheses have been proposed to account for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. To examine these hypotheses, perception of global-local patterns was studied in 22 patients with schizophrenia and 28 normal comparison participants. The patients with schizophrenia showed an abnormally exaggerated global processing advantage when attention was divided between global and local levels but not when participants were instructed to attend to either the local or global level. This finding suggested a local processing (left hemisphere) deficit, which was overcome through strategic attentional allocation (instructional set). When the stimulus visual angle was reduced from 9degree to 3degree, the normal participants showed a shift from a local to a global processing advantage, but the patients did not. This finding suggested a more subtle deficit in strategic attentional processes that develop through exposure to stimulus context. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors previously observed that schizophrenic patients generated fewer fixations of <= 50.1 ms in response to faces than did a clinical control group. This study examined whether deficits in short-duration eye movements were related to patients' problems in gestalt perception of faces. Faces were presented in upright and inverted orientations to examine the effects of distorting facial gestalts on eye movements. Normal subjects generated more saccades of <= 50.1 ms to upright than to inverted faces. Patients' saccades of <= 50.1 ms did not differ between orientations. Patterns of fixations and of saccades > 50.1 ms did not differ between groups. The results may indicate deficits in these patients in search strategies that underlie perception of facial gestalts.

AB  - Delusional parasitosis (DP) is associated in 5-15% with shared psychotic disorder (SPD). Little systematic information is available about this particular aspect of the syndrome. A thorough review of all published cases with DP was carried out. 68 case histories of SPD were identified (5.67%). The data of these patients were compared with those of their inducers (n = 44) and with the data of DP patients, who did not transfer their delusional beliefs to others (n = 1,155). Approximately 30% of the psychotic dyads were reported from public health departments. The sex ratio was balanced in the SPD group, but showed a clear preponderance of females in the other two groups. SPD patients and their inducers reported more frequently visual illusions or hallucinations and located the animals correspondingly upon the surface of the skin. No diagnostic differences were found between the inducers and those who had DP but did not induce SPD in others. Albeit 50% of the SPD patients did not receive any treatment except separation from the inducer, the remission rate in this group was 93%.

AB  - Assuming a particular psychological function of optical gestalt perception, its impairment would lead to a decreasing extent of gestalt related optical illusion. An increase of optical illusion would be expected in the case of a loss of adaptability and cognitive compensation, usually revising the phenomenon of optical illusion. 16 demented out-patients were compared to 16 hospitalized schizophrenics by a 'Computerized Assessment of Change in Optical Illusion' (CACOI), measuring the extent of optical illusion by patient's assessment of 12 variations of the figure of Mueller-Lyer, differing in baseline length. The results showed a significant increase of optical illusion in demented patients compared to the schizophrenic controls (p = 0.019). Taking into account that the extent of optical illusion by the figure of Mueller-Lyer usually is decreasing with age and was found to be increased in schizophrenics, our results support the hypothesis of an early loss of adaptability and cognitive compensation in dementia.

AB  - Validity studies of neuropsychological tests have typically examined individuals with neurological disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the construct validity of neuropsychological measures in patients with schizophrenia. We used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) factor scores that were generated from the population of interest as marker variables in the present analysis. The current study included 39 patients with schizophrenia who were evaluated with a battery of neuropsychological tests assessing attention, memory, and abstract reasoning abilities. Pearson correlations indicated significant relationships between (a) WAIS-R Verbal Comprehension factor and tests of sustained attention, verbal memory and remote memory; (b) WAIS-R Perceptual Organization factor and tests of visual memory and abstraction and problem solving; and (c) WAIS-R Freedom From Distractibility factor and neuropsychological measures of attention and concentration. These results provide support for the construct validity of the neuropsychological tests in patients with schizophrenia, and indicate that these tests evaluate essentially the same constructs in patients with schizophrenia as they do for patients with structural neurological disorders.

AB  - Although factor scores are commonly used to interpret the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), the WAIS-R factor structure has not been investigated in patients with schizophrenia. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine five latent construct models in 169 males with schizophrenia. The WAIS-R standardization sample (ages 35-44; n = 250) was used as a comparison group. For both groups, all model fit indexes used to determine model adequacy supported models composed of Verbal Comprehension (VC), Perceptual Organization (PO) and Freedom from Distractibility (FFD) factors. However, the Digit Symbol subtest loaded on both the PO and FFD factors for patients with schizophrenia but only on the FFD factor for the WAIS-R standardization sample. Patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse on the FFD and PO factors compared to the VC factor, reflecting the well-characterized attention and problem solving deficits associated with schizophrenia. Also, patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the WAIS-R sample on all factors. These results provide support for the validity of the WAIS-R factors in patients with schizophrenia.

AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two distinct categories of mental disorders in the DSM-IV. However, it is often difficult to make a differential diagnosis because of the overlapping symptoms. A potential adjunct in the classification of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is the application of information processing models, as patients with schizophrenia and possibly those with bipolar disorder have information processing deficits. A study was conducted in which a computerized battery of information processing tasks (called COGLAB) was administered to three participant groups: patients with schizophrenia, patients with bipolar disorder, and normal controls. The tasks included the Mueller-Lyer illusion, reaction time, size estimation, a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, backward masking, and Asarnow continuous performance. Discriminant analyses were used to investigate the differences among the three groups. Results indicated that COGLAB correctly classified 75.5% of the cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Mueller-Lyer illusion and the number of perseverative errors on the card sort most powerfully discriminated the two groups.

AB  - Recent epidemiological and psychobiological studies indicate that psychopharmacology is promising, even for the treatment of personality disorders. Psychotropic drugs may have positive effects on personality disorders that show a close relationship to Axis I disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder - schizophrenia simplex; avoidant personality disorder - generalized social phobia; borderline personality disorder - affective disorders, etc.). In addition, psychotropic drugs may influence certain psychopathological symptom clusters (e.g., cognitive-perceptual organization, impulsivity/aggressivity, affective instability, anxiety/inhibition) present in various disorders. Psychotropic drugs may also be indicated when psychiatric comorbidity exists. The results of clinical pharmacological studies are reviewed with reference to cluster A, B, and C personality disorders. Some guidelines can be drawn from these trials. Clinically, the use of psychotropic drugs in symptomatic crises should be considered, especially when a secondary psychiatric comorbidity exists. Pharmacotherapy is well indicated for personality disorders closely associated with Axis I disorders. Usually pharmacotherapy is short term, although in some cases long-term treatment may be promising. However, pharmacotherapy must always refer to a supportive therapeutic interaction between physician and patient.

AB  - This report describes part of a series of experiments, conducted within the framework of feature integration theory, to determine whether patients with schizophrenia show deficits in preattentive processing. Thirty subjects with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia and 30 age-, gender-, and education-matched normal control subjects completed two computerized experimental tasks, a visual search task assessing the frequency of illusory conjunctions (i.e. false perceptions) under conditions of divided attention (Experiment 3) and a task which examined the effects of perceptual grouping on illusory conjunctions (Experiment 4). We also assessed current symptomatology and its relationship to task performance. Contrary to our hypotheses, schizophrenia subjects did not show higher rates of illusory conjunctions, and the influence of perceptual grouping on the frequency of illusory conjunctions was similar for schizophrenia and control subjects. Nonetheless, specific predictions from feature integration theory about the impact of different target types (Experiment 3) and perceptual groups (Experiment 4) on the likelihood of forming an illusory conjunction were strongly supported, thereby confirming the integrity of the experimental procedures. Overall, these studies revealed no firm evidence that schizophrenia is associated with a preattentive abnormality in visual search using stimuli that differ on the basis of physical characteristics.

AB  - To help determine whether patients with schizophrenia show deficits in the stimulus-based aspects of preattentive processing, we undertook a series of experiments within the framework of feature integration theory. Thirty subjects with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia and 30 age-, gender-, and education-matched normal control subjects completed two computerized experimental tasks, a visual search task assessing parallel and serial information processing (Experiment 1) and a task which examined the effects of perceptual grouping on visual search strategies (Experiment 2). We also assessed current symptomatology and its relationship to task performance. While the schizophrenia subjects had longer reaction times in Experiment 1, their overall pattern of performance across both experimental tasks was similar to that of the control subjects, and generally unrelated to current symptomatology. Predictions from feature integration theory about the impact of varying display size (Experiment 1) and number of perceptual groups (Experiment 2) on the detection of feature and conjunction targets were strongly supported. This study revealed no firm evidence that schizophrenia is associated with a preattentive abnormality in visual search using stimuli that differ on the basis of physical characteristics. While subject and task characteristics may partially account for differences between this and previous studies, it is more likely that preattentive processing abnormalities in schizophrenia may occur only under conditions involving selected 'top-down' factors such as context and meaning.

Forty-three people participated in the study: patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (14) or with bipolar disorder (15), and "normal" participants (14). All 3 groups of participants showed performance superiority in the condition that was facilitated by the use of the Gestalt principles in both tasks. This study supports the hypothesis that visual perceptual organization, in terms of utilizing the Gestalt principles, is relatively intact in people with schizophrenia.

AB  - 17 subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and hallucinations in their case history were compared with 16 subjects of a reference group regarding the appearance of a perception of streaming in a presentation of pitch alternating tones. One scale going up and down was used as part of a stimulus and the same scale going down and up as the other part (as distracter). The amplitude of the distracter was varied in order to make the perceptual regrouping (streaming) evident, which normally occurs when the amplitude approaches the same level in the two stimuli. Sixteen presentations were made. The subjects of the reference group began to hear the streaming after the sixth presentation and all of them heard it at the eighth. At the eleventh presentation some ceased to perceive any streaming and none heard it after the fourteenth presentation. In the schizophrenic group none showed a normal pattern. Overall, less than half of the schizophrenic probands heard a streaming when subjects in the reference group did. Amongst those who did, a few heard it early and kept hearing it to the end. Others started to hear it late and kept hearing it to the end, while a few heard it on and off. The remarkable aberrant grouping strategies among the schizophrenics are discussed in relation to current ideas on perceptual disturbances of the illness.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies of attention/information processing impairments in schizophrenia suggest that patients with the deficit syndrome should be characterized by impaired performance on measures of visual information processing. Therefore, the authors examined whether two measures of visual information processing, a degraded stimulus version of the continuous performance test and a forced choice span of apprehension task, were uniquely related to the deficit syndrome. Method(s): Performance on the continuous performance test and span of apprehension task was examined in 20 deficit and 56 nondeficit patients with schizophrenia and in 27 subjects in a normal comparison group. Result(s): Deficit patients performed significantly less well than both nondeficit patients and the normal comparison group on the continuous performance test and span of apprehension task. There were no significant differences between the nondeficit patients and the normal group on the continuous performance test, but nondeficit patients performed significantly less well on the span of apprehension task than the normal group. Differences between the deficit and nondeficit patients in performance on the continuous performance test and span of apprehension task were not related to total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale factor 1 or on the Thought, Language, and Communication scale or to neuroleptic level. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that deficit patients are uniquely characterized by impaired performance on the continuous performance test. The deficit patients' differential performance on the continuous performance test may be related to either an inability to activate and allocate attention or an impairment in the perceptual organization of visual information.

AB  - Perceptual organization of auditory information is influenced by both the physical characteristics and the categorization of irrelevant information. This study sought to determine the degree to which schizophrenia patients could utilize acoustic properties and contextual cues (top-down factors) to segregate relevant from irrelevant material in an auditory stream. On a modification of I. Neath, A. M. Surprenant, and R. G. Crowder's (1993) auditory suffix task, both schizophrenia and control participants demonstrated better recall of relevant information when irrelevant information had different physical characteristics, compared with when both arose from the same source. In contrast, schizophrenia patients were unaffected by a contextual manipulation that allowed controls to reduce the interfering effect of an irrelevant stimulus. These data suggest that a reduced ability to utilize contextual information plays a role in the perceptual organization dysfunction in schizophrenia.

AB  - Two studies assessed perceptual organization in schizophrenia to determine (a) whether inpatient and outpatient groups with poor premorbid schizophrenia have comparable levels of perceptual organization deficit; and (b) whether the deficit could be eliminated by task manipulations. In Study 1, inpatients demonstrated clear evidence of a perceptual organization deficit, whereas outpatients performed similarly to the control groups. In Study 2, a performance pattern that operationally defined a perceptual organization deficit was eliminated by a task manipulation thought to aid in context processing. The perceptual organization deficit is most pronounced in actively symptomatic patients with poor premorbid schizophrenia, and the deficit reflects, in part, deficient top-down influences to basic perceptual processes.

AB  - The Dot Enumeration Perceptual Organization Task (DEPOT) evaluates the validity of 2 specific competing cognitive models of early input dysfunction in schizophrenic individuals: a primary Stage 1, sensory store, perceptual organization deficit vs. a Stage 2, short-term visual memory (STVM) deficit. DEPOT was also designed to assess the hypothesis that schizophrenic individuals tend to perform poorly on all cognitive tasks. In DEPOT both number and form judgments are made about the same dot patterns. A response delay manipulation assesses the persistence and operation of STVM. The study included 41 psychotic inpatients (8 with acute and 16 with chronic schizophrenia and 7 with bipolar and 10 with nonbipolar affective disorder) and 38 controls (22 college students and 16 hospital personnel). Although the pattern of results was consistent with neither the Stage I deficit nor the general deficit hypotheses, a Stage 2, STVM deficit hypothesis could account parsimoniously for the data.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests the presence of a lateralizing attentional deficit in schizophrenia. In the present study, 23 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (mean age = 32.1 years) and 14 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were studied with the Global/Local Task to provide converging evidence for the presence of a left-hemisphere-associated attentional deficit in schizophrenia. This task is sensitive to the integrity of mechanisms involved in discriminating local and global elements of stimuli. Previous research has linked the discrimination of local targets to left hemispheric processes and the discrimination of global targets to right hemispheric processes. As predicted, patients were impaired in the detection of local level targets, consistent with a left hemispheric deficit. The degree of impairment correlated with the patient's level of auditory hallucinations. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an asymmetrical attentional deficit in schizophrenia and left hemispheric dysfunction. The correlation between this deficit and auditory hallucinations is consistent with a hypothesized relationship between this symptom in schizophrenia and left temporal pathology.

AB  - Patients with neurodevelopmental syndromes often receive numerous psychiatric diagnoses before the true nature of their disorder becomes apparent. We present a case in which the neuropsychological evaluation played a significant role in reconceptualizing a patient who had received, at various times, diagnoses of schizotypal personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. The identification of specific cognitive deficits in executive functioning, perceptual organization, visual-spatial problem solving, and abstraction led to: 1) a diagnosis of nonverbal perceptual-organization-output disabled; 2) the adoption of a rehabilitative treatment model; and 3) a greater understanding of the way in which the patient's social deficits represented adaptations to her cognitive impairments. Research data and theoretical models relating cognitive deficits to psychiatric symptoms are discussed, and evidence is presented that schizophrenia and certain neurodevelopmental syndromes may share commonalities of pathophysiology. Diagnostic issues arising from similarities between these disorders are discussed. It is suggested that direct comparisons between these groups can aid in clarifying the specific nature of cognitive deficit-symptom relationships, as well as leading to improvements in the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenic and neurodevelopmental syndromes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy') has become one of the most widely used illicit substances in the UK. Little is known of the psychiatric morbidity which may be associated with its use. We have examined this association by collecting a series of psychiatric cases in which MDMA use was a prominent feature., METHOD: Patients presenting between 1990 and 1992 with psychiatric symptoms which developed in the context of MDMA use (n = 13) were interviewed, and their psychiatric, medical and drug history, sociodemographic background and mental state were examined in detail. The psychopathology of cases with psychosis (n = 8) was assessed with the Present State Examination and compared with that of substance-naive psychotic controls (n = 40)., RESULTS: Eight patients presented with psychotic syndromes, two experienced visual illusions, hallucinations and palinopsia, one had panic attacks, one suffered from depression, and one described chronic depersonalisation and derealisation. The psychopathology of the patients with psychoses was very similar to that of controls., CONCLUSIONS: Use of MDMA may be associated with a broader spectrum of psychiatric morbidity than heretofore suspected. Cases with psychosis may be clinically similar to psychotic patients with no history of substance use.

AB  - Used a size estimation (SE) paradigm and the Mueller-Lyer (ML) illusion to examine perceptual disturbances in schizophrenics. 35 schizophrenic Ss (mean age 31.9 yrs) were compared to 20 Ss with no history of psychiatric illness. Perceptual distortions found in previous studies of schizophrenics were only confirmed to a certain extent in the present results. More overestimators were found among the schizophrenic Ss than among the normal Ss on the SE task. The schizophrenic Ss, especially the chronic Ss, also proved to be more prone to the ML illusion. A reason why the very clear differences between schizophrenic Ss and normal Ss found in previous examinations were not confirmed in the present study might be that a reliable diagnostic instrument was used for the 1st time in this kind of study.

AB  - Visual distractibility was studied in schizophrenic patients. Subjects had to respond to target stimuli while they ignored the visual context, which was either congruent, neutral, or incongruent with respect to the target stimulus. Eighteen schizophrenic patients and 18 healthy subjects performed this flanker task. Schizophrenic patients did not show increased distractibility compared with healthy subjects, and both groups showed the same attenuation of visual context effects when the spatial distance between target and flanker stimuli was increased. The two groups showed the same amount of interference by incongruent visual context. Thus, schizophrenic patients did not show enhanced distractibility, spatial extension of attention, or response competition. When flanker and target stimuli were redundant, the responses of schizophrenic patients were less accelerated than those of healthy subjects.

AB  - Irrelevant stimuli that flank a fixated target may cause either facilitation or interference with target classification. 20 schizophrenic patients, 20 depressed control patients, and 20 normal control Ss were compared on a flanker priming task that involved the linear display of a target surrounded by 2 flanking letters or digits. Choice %RT% between letter and digit targets was examined as a function of flanker condition and onset asynchrony between flankers and target. Facilitative priming occurred only with prior exposure of flankers compatible with the response required and was greater in degree with schizophrenic and depressed than with normal Ss. Interference from flankers incompatible with the response required occurred less among schizophrenics than among other groups. Several different processes may be involved in the inhibition of irrelevant information by schizophrenics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 1993
AB  - An aspect of the considerable research on the association between eating disorders and discrepancies in body image estimation is the extent, if at all, that such discrepancies could be due to a more general tendency to show a positive or negative bias in estimation of the size of objects. One hundred female subjects, without known eating disorder, estimated the width of their own bodies (head, shoulders, waist, and hips), of another person's body (waist and hips), of four commercial packages, and of a cylinder. Errors in estimation, computed as algebraic differences from the true value, were computed, and all error means were found to be positive. Correlations between the error scores were all positive. Factor analysis of the correlations between the 11 error scores indicated a substantial general factor plus a bipolar factor, or alternatively two positively correlated factors referring to human body or physical measures. Results were interpreted as supporting the notion of a broad general tendency to enhance or diminish estimations of the width of familiar objects including estimations of the width of own body parts. The relevance of this finding to eating disorders was discussed.

AB  - The preattentive visual information processing of hypothetically psychosis-prone college Ss was evaluated using 3 different paradigms: target detection (n = 57), visual suffix effect (n = 57), and configural superiority effect (n = 68). It was hypothesized that anhedonic Ss would show the same perceptual organization deficits reported in process schizophrenics and that perceptual aberration-magical ideation Ss and depressed Ss would perform similarly to control Ss. In each study, anhedonics performed similarly to each comparison group, even though there was adequate power to detect performance differences if they existed. A framework for understanding the visual information-processing deficits of schizophrenics and high-risk Ss is proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Bupropion hydrochloride is a phenylaminoketone antidepressant whose clinical pharmacology is poorly understood. Part of bupropion's action may be attributed to inhibition of dopamine reuptake that may induce organic mental disorders in certain susceptible patients. We report three cases of organic mental disorders in patients receiving bupropion hydrochloride for treatment of the depressed phase of their bipolar-type mood instability. The organic mental disorders that occurred in these patients were characterized largely by visual disturbances-visual hallucinations and visual illusions-although one patient also experienced auditory hallucinations. The patients' use of concomitant medications and potential drug interactions are carefully evaluated and the literature on bupropion's ability to induce organic mental disorders is reviewed. We suggest a number of possible mediating mechanisms for these syndromes including dose-related dopaminergic augmentation, accumulation of toxic metabolites, predisposition to psychosis, and drug interactions.

AB  - We present a patient with serologically confirmed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection who had illusions of size, shape, and colour of objects but none of the typical symptoms and signs peculiar to infectious mononucleosis (IM) except sore throat which developed 2 weeks after the initial visual disturbances. The bizarre feelings about the images of body and objects are called the 'Alice in Wonderland syndrome' due to the similarity with Alice's dreams. The same symptomatology including visual metamorphosia is defined in patients with migraine, epilepsy, intoxication due to hallucinogenic drugs, schizophrenia, hyperpyrexia, and cerebral lesions. Alice in Wonderland syndrome has also been reported in the course of IM.

TI  - Visual perceptual organization in schizophrenic patients
DO  - NA

PY  - 1991
AB  - Place and Gilmore (1980) proposed that schizophrenic patients are deficient in the perceptual organization of visual stimuli. According to their theory, the patients should be less influenced by global characteristics of visual displays. In the present experimental approach, 24 schizophrenics, 12 alcoholics and 24 healthy controls were asked to identify the number of lines presented for 23 ms on a video screen. In one condition, the stimuli were identical to those used by Place and Gilmore: up to six lines were shown at the corners of an imaginary hexagon; all lines were either in the same direction (' homogeneous ') or differed in orientation (' heterogeneous '). In another condition the lines appeared at 10 different positions within the same field. The results of Place and Gilmore were not replicated; schizophrenics were only less influenced than the control group by different directions of the lines when three lines were presented. When more lines were presented, schizophrenics had the same advantage from homogeneity as the controls. If the basic configuration was a hexagon and six lines were presented, schizophrenics were able to profit very strongly from the global Gestalt. In summary, global characteristics of the visual displays do not facilitate visual information processing by schizophrenics as they do in the case of controls. However, if the basic Gestalt properties are strong enough, schizophrenics can take advantage of it. Thus the deficit of schizophrenics described by Place and Gilmore is relative and not absolute.

PY  - 1991
AB  - A computer model of simulated bipolar cells (BC) in the human retina is used to study wavelength discrimination (lambda delta). lambda delta curves are obtained for the two C-types of BCs in the central fovea and the three C-type BCs of the parafovea under various conditions. For the parafovea algebraic addition of the three C-type BCs with proper weighting of the blue-center BC, such that the unique orange locus = 600 nm, gives a combined channel whose lambda delta curve agrees remarkably well with those found in the literature based on human and primate psychophysics. Other studies include effects of chromatic adaptation and dispersion on lambda delta. From this and earlier studies it can be concluded that the center/surround organization of the BCs optimize resolution in the presence of natural occurring dispersion; in addition a specific BC receptive field organization could be picked as being optimal.

AB  - Contrast thresholds for, and contrast matches between, stationary gratings of three spatial frequencies (0.5, 2, and 8 c/deg) were measured on eight subjects with a history of schizophrenia,just before, and again two to three days after, a therapeutic injection of depot neuroleptic. The drug enhanced sensitivity at the low, and reduced it at the medium and high spatial frequency. After injection, subjects required more contrast to match the apparent contrast of the high, and less contrast to match that of the low, to that of the medium spatial frequency. Pupillary measurements suggested that these effects were not due to drug-induced changes in pupil size. The results are discussed in terms of the functional role of dopamine in the retina, and a possible application in therapy for amblyopia.

TI  - Filling the preparatory interval with temporal information or visual noise: Crossover effect in schizophrenics and controls
DO  - NA

PY  - 1989
AB  - Three variants of a simple reaction time task with regular and irregular series of different preparatory intervals (PIs) were presented to schizophrenics and a control group of alcoholics and normals: the visual warning signal (WS) either (1) remained fixed, (2) shrank at a constant rate, or (3) changed in size erratically. Time information provided by shrinking WSs reduced the average reaction time in all groups and attenuated the crossover effect (COE) of schizophrenics, although even here more schizophrenics than controls had COE-scores >= 25 msec. Erratically changing WSs introduced the COE in controls. Within groups the COE was not related to general response speed, age, duration of hospitalization, or medication. Results are interpreted as indicating that schizophrenics eschew controlled anticipatory processes on the basis of WS- and PI-information which are crucial for motor preparation when PIs are too long to allow an automatic perceptual grouping of warning and imperative stimulus. This may also occur in controls when time estimation is impeded by distraction.

PY  - 1988
AB  - The organization of the rod spherule and of the horizontal cell axon terminals within the invagination of the rod spherule in the human retina was examined in serial sections by electron microscopy. Twenty-one rod spherules were reconstructed in this study. Axon terminal processes of type I horizontal cells consistently make one or two small punctate synapses onto each rod spherule within the invagination. In addition, these axon terminal processes make distinct synapses upon rod bipolar dendrites outside the spherule before both processes enter the invagination. This is the first positive description of a synapse from a horizontal cell axon terminal process onto a photoreceptor terminal and the first identification of a synapse from a horizontal cell to a rod bipolar cell in the mammalian outer plexiform layer. We speculate that the axon terminal-to-rod synapse is responsible for feedback while the synapse upon the rod bipolar cell is feed-forward and serves to expand the receptive field of the rod bipolar cell beyond its dendritic field. Alternatively, the latter may contribute to a center-surround organization of the rod bipolar's receptive field.

AB  - An oblique, five-factor model of a modified Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery is presented. One hundred fifty-one neuropsychiatric inpatients (94 men, 57 women) were examined on 44 neuropsychological indices. Five correlated dimensions (r = .25), viz., Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, Sensory-attention, Primary Motor, and Tactile-spatial abilities, were identified by maximum likelihood factor analyses of this correlation matrix. These findings are quite similar to those reported earlier by Fowler, Richards, Berent, and Boll (1985, 1987) and Royce, Yeudall, and Bock (1976). The factors may be broadly categorized using the distinction made by Lezak (1983) for verbal, nonverbal, and mental activity variables. MANOVAs revealed systematic relationships between simple-weighted factor scores and: (1) the overall level of cognitive functioning (p less than .01), as well as (2) psychiatric diagnosis (p less than .01). Implications of these findings for understanding the impact of neuropsychiatric disorders on the structure of abilities for such patients are developed.

AB  - E. Place and G. Gilmore (see record 1980-25819-001) found that schizophrenics, unlike control Ss failed to utilize gestalt grouping principles in a task involving line counting. The present investigation was a replication of that study but with several methodological refinements, including the subtyping of schizophrenics, a fixed exposure duration of 15 msec, and analyses of both raw and arcsin transformed data. Ss were 10 paranoid schizophrenic, 10 nonparanoid schizophrenic, and 10 nonschizophrenic patients (mean age 31 yrs) and 10 normal undergraduates. The basic findings of Place and Gilmore held, and the refinements utilized made no difference. Results are discussed in terms of a 2-stage model of perceptual processing that describes normal perception in terms of an intitial global structuring of the stimulus field and a secondary local analysis. Schizophrenics appear to use the 2nd processing stage regardless of the stimulus condition. (14 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes a strategy for examining cognitive functioning in psychotic and normal children without the usual confounding effects of marked differences in cognitive structure that occur when children of the same age are compared. 12 male and 2 female psychotics, aged 6 yrs 4 mo to 11 yrs 10 mo, were matched with 14 controls at preoperational and concrete operational stage levels on a set of Piagetian classification tasks. The controls were aged 3 yrs 9 mo to 10 yrs 2 mo, replicating the usually found developmental delay in psychotic samples. Ss were compared on both structural level and functional abilities on a set of tasks involving seriation of sticks; the higher-level Ss were also administered a seriation drawing task. Ss' processes of seriating and seriation drawings indicate that over and above the structural retardation, psychotic children at all levels showed functional deficits, especially in the use of anticipatory imagery. The implications for general developmental theory are that progress in structural development is not sufficient for imaginal development and that structural development of logical concepts is relatively independent of the development of imagery. It is suggested that "thought disorder" may not be a disordered structure of thinking or a retardation in psychotic populations but rather a mismatch between higher-level logical structures and lower-level functions.

PY  - 1984
AB  - Two classes of amacrine cells are simulated, small-field and large-field. Small-field amacrine cells are formed by input from a single bipolar cell, while large-field amacrine cell is formed by inputs from same 7 bipolar cells that form the ganglion cell. Only tonic amacrine cells are studied with both chromatic and luminosity types as well as double- and single-opponent receptive fields. Amacrine cells are used in both feedforward to ganglion cells and feedback to bipolar and horizontal cells. Feedback to bipolar cells or feedforward to ganglion cells affected steady state levels in a predictable fashion. Negative feedback to bipolar cells and positive feedforward to ganglion cells does not introduce transients to ganglion cells while negative feedback to horizontal cells and negative feedforward does. Feedback to horizontal cells produces complex effects on bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells dependent on such factors as center-surround field balance and negative feedback from luminosity type of horizontal cell to cones.

AB  - Imagery and verbal aspects of schizophrenic informational performance were examined. Pictorially and verbally presented pairs of items were compared with respect to both pronounceability of their names and their real-life sizes. Results indicated slower stimulus encoding of pictorial than verbal stimulation among the schizophrenics, especially paranoids. On the other hand, comparison of item properties appeared intact regardless of stimulus-presentation format. Non-paranoids made fewer errors as size judgements became more difficult, suggesting protection against erroneously stating the presence of stimulus properties. Scores from a questionnaire directed toward habitual use of imagery and verbal processes indicated significantly greater preference for the latter among paranoids.

Indices of the ability (a) to make use of redundant stimulus cues, (b) to filter irrelevant stimulus features, and (c) to scan the perceptual field for relevant stimulus features, indicate that only filtering was consistently poor in schizophrenia. It has been suggested that schizophrenic patients may tend to perceive their environment in an undifferentiated holistic manner rather than in an analytic manner and the implication for the theory of left hemisphere pathology in schizophrenia is discussed. However, the performance of the schizophrenic Ss did not differ significantly from that of the control group of depressed patients, which suggests that the selective attention deficits previously observed in schizophrenia are not specific to the disorder.

AB  - Water-soluble contrast media, which have been employed in the examination of the lumbar spinal canal for 30 years, can sometimes result in severe complications, such as arachnoiditis, epileptic seizures, and myoclonic spasm. These complications have been seen less frequently since the advent of metrizamide, a new non-ionic water-soluble contrast medium. However, a further neurological complication has now arisen--mental disorder, varying in kind and degree; for example, organic psychosis and perceptual disturbance. Some characteristic cases are described. A series of 75 patients, all of whom received varying amounts of metrizamide for the purpose of cervical, thoracic and lumbar myelography, has been studied. Seven patients were found to have a pronounced organic psychosis and three patients had visual illusions or hallucinations. It is suggested that there is some degree of correlation between the total amount of iodine received and patient age. By careful enquiry and examination, similar disturbances were also found some 4-8 h after myelography with other water-soluble contrast media.

Types of information-processing used by the schizophrenics were also examined. All groups identified letters with greater accuracy with left hemisphere presentation. Group differences in the letter task disappeared once education was controlled. No hemisphere effect was found for dot enumeration, but group differences emerged. As predicted, Ps and controls processed the dots serially and hence decreased in accuracy over frame size. NPs processed in an automatic mode, revealing the same degree of accuracy over all dot sizes. The poorer performance of the NPs in dot enumeration is discussed in terms of the task requiring bilateral processing and the NPs' failure to integrate the processing of the 2 hemispheres.

AB  - 24 male schizophrenics, 12 with schizophrenia in the immediate family (SFH) and 12 with no evidence of schizophrenia in the family background (SNFH), and 24 male control Ss, 12 highly educated (HEC) and 12 minimally educated (MEC), were assessed for premorbid social adjustment and were administered the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a size estimation task, and the EEG average evoked response (AER) at different levels of stimulus intensity. As predicted from the stimulus redundancy formulation, SFH Ss were poorer in premorbid adjustment, were less often paranoid, functioned at a lower level of cognitive efficiency (poor digit symbol and greater absolute error on size estimation), were more chronic, and, in some respects, had size estimation indices of minimal scanning. Contrary to prediction, the SFH group had the strongest and most sustained augmenting response on AER, while the SNFH group shifted from an augmenting to a reducing pattern of response. The relationship between an absence of AER reducing and the presence of cognitive impairment in the SFH group is discussed. (33 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Preattentive information processing was examined in matched samples of 15 process nonparanoid schizophrenics, 15 reactive paranoid schizophrenics, and 15 nonschizophrenic psychiatric inpatients (mean ages 33.53, 32.87, and 36.13 yrs, respectively). Three measures of visual preattentive processing were administered under standard conditions and under enriched conditions in which preattentive discriminability was enhanced through increased perceptual grouping and segregation. Nonparanoid schizophrenics displayed a differential performance deficit under standard conditions on each measure. Under conditions of enhanced preattentive discriminability, nonparanoid schizophrenics differentially improved to the extent that no significant differences were found between groups on 2 of the measures. Paranoid schizophrenics and psychiatric controls did not differ significantly across measures or conditions. (37 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied perceptual response styles of 8 paranoid and 8 nonparanoid schizophrenics in a VA hospital using size estimation and perceptual recognition tasks. Eight alcoholic patients were used as controls. Only acute, actively psychotic, unmedicated schizophrenics were included. Heart rate responses were monitored during the performance of the tasks. Psychological task performance and concomitant physiological responses were analyzed and integrated. The size estimation results replicate earlier findings. During the perceptual recognition task, the paranoid Ss showed a unique "jump to conclusions" response strategy. Early responding and response rigidity was not found to be specific to paranoid schizophrenics. All schizophrenic Ss showed more large-magnitude heart rate response during both tasks. The relationship between perceptual responses and physiological responses differed among the groups. (45 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Fifteen paranoid and 15 nonparanoid schizophrenics and 15 normal controls were administered a size estimation task which featured two administrations of nonthematic standard stimuli. The standard stimuli were presented under three conditions of background stimuli: a) surrounded by four smaller stimuli of the same kind; b) surrounded by four larger stimuli of the same kind; c) presented without background stimuli. Standard stimuli were presented at exposure times of 33 and 4000 milliseconds. On the first administration, nonparanoid schizophrenics were found to overestimate size relative to paranoidschizophrenics with normal controls intermediate in performance between the paranoid schizophrenics and nonparanoid schizophrenics, particularly on longer stimulus exposure times. The groups did not differ on the second administration. This replication of the results of earlier investigations suggest that the repeated administration of size estimation procedures in which the effects of sequence and thematic content stimuli were inextricably confounded may have contributed to recent conflicting findings in the size estimation literature. Contrary to predictions generated by Cromwell's stimulus redundancy formation, the paranoid schizophrenics were not more affected by the size of the background stimuli than the nonparanoid schizophrenics.

AB  - Eighteen paranoid schizophrenics, 18 non-paranoid schizophrenics and 18 normal subjects were shown a set of 36 schematic drawings of human faces. The faces varied along four dimensions: nose length, chin length, distance between eyes, and forehead height. Subjects were asked to rate each face as either 'intelligent' or 'unintelligent' and then as either 'contented' or 'discontented'. The paranoid schizophrenics were less systematic than both the normals and non-paranoid schizophrenics in their use of the stimulus dimensions in the judgements, the latter two groups not significantly differing in this respect. It was also found that there were significant differences among the groups regarding the average importance given to the different physical features, the profiles for the two schizophrenic groups being flatter than that of the non-schizophrenics. The results suggested there were two aspects of consistency in dimension utilization involved in the overall group differences-between-subject and within-subject consistency. The paranoid schizophrenics displayed low within-subject consistency, the non-paranoid schizophrenics displayed a high within-subject consistency but low between-subject consistency (i.e. an idiosyncratic weighting of dimensions in their judgements), and the non-schizophrenics displayed high within- and between-subject consistency.

AB  - Thirteen autistic children were compared to 13 normal children matched to them in mental age, on performance of a visual discrimination task. Form, color, and size were relevant and redundant cues. The groups did not differ significantly in mean trials to reach criterion or in breadth of learning, and both groups increased their breadth of learning after 50 trials of overtraining. Form was preferred to color and size by both autistic and normal children. Within each group, rank on mental age was highly correlated with rank in breadth of learning. Verbal and nonverbal autistic children did not differ in breadth of learning or in dimensional preference. Even nonverbal autistics equaled the performance of their normal controls. Our results suggest that overselective attention is better understood as part of a general developmental lag in cognition in autistic children than as a specific deficit underlying psychotic behavior.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that for 2 subgroups of patients, schizophrenics with premorbid asociality (SPA) and individuals with emotionally unstable character disorders (EUCD), CNS damage may have etiologic significance. It was hypothesized that these 2 patient groups would also have an increased number of neurologic soft signs. The relationship of neurologic examination, tests of auditory-visual integration, and intelligence (WAIS or WISC), and diagnoses was studied for 350 patients (under age 50). Tests of reliability and persistence for all observed signs were performed. The EUCD and SPA groups (27 and 22 Ss, respectively) had increased evidence of neurologic soft signs. Differences in patterns of IQ scores also suggested that different forms of brain damage may be present in these 2 groups. When the 2 groups were removed from the larger patient sample, those with other types of schizophrenia and character disorder did not exhibit neurologic impairment. Data support the validity of considering SPA and EUCD as separate diagnostic entities. (19 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There has long been dissatisfaction with the concept of schizophrenia as a unitary disease process. Since Kraepelin's (1919) definition of dementia praecox as an incurable, deteriorative disorder, there have been attempts to differentiate various kinds of schizophrenias. The differentiation most commonly used in clinical practice has been that based on labeling different clusters of symptoms, as in simple schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, hebephrenia, and so on. Another differentiation, to be described more fully, is the process-reactive one based on a patient's particular life history and prognosis. A trend throughout much of the literature relates some of the research in the process-reactive area to one critical area-the developmental level. The developmental view maintains that process and reactive schizophrenics are at different levels of maturation in any or all modes of functioning, either being fixated at some particular stage or having regressed to a particular stage. The emphasis of the present paper will be on three particular areas of study: conceptual, verbal, and perceptual functioning. The developmental differences that are evident may have serious implications for the therapeutic approach to the two types of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, there is often no attention at all paid to the process-reactive distinction in treatment procedures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

The present study explored the test-retest reliability of this scale with 40 process schizophrenics over a 2-wk interval. Results show that reliability was adequate for both males and females (.84) for the total scale. The 4 components of the scale were also reliable. No S changed on retest with respect to adient or abient orientation. Interjudge reliability was very high (.912). (16 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Two groups of physically healthy schizophrenic patients comprised of fifteen withdrawn and fifteen actives per group with comparable sex and age distribution were selected for this study. Both groups were placed first in a quiet environment in which the noise level was kept between 40-60 decibels, for three hours each morning for six weeks' duration. Therapeutic and psychological and clinical parameters were used to examine the effects of this particular environment. At the end of six weeks, they were switched to a noisy environment with the noise level averaging 80-90 decibels. Noisy environment increased the withdrawn groups' motor and verbal performance, improved perceptual organization, improved sleep pattern and hallucinations. As a result, overall improvement caused medication decrease. For the active group, in a noisy environment, performance decreased, conceptual disorganization, anxiety and restlessness heightened, resulting in an increase of 40% in their medication. The withdrawn group in the quiet environment showed considerable regression with heightened autism, seclusiveness, more conceptual disorganization and disturbed sleep patterns with increased hallucinations. The active group in the quiet environment showed improved performance, decreased anxiety, more conceptual organization, less hallucinations, better sleep patterns; motor and verbal productivity increased.

AB  - Replicated and extended an earlier study, to test the prediction from the W. E. Broen and L. H. Storms theory that under certain conditions schizophrenics will display an arousal-produced decrement at the training stimulus on a generalization gradient. 14 acute schizophrenics and 10 nonschizophrenics were taught to press a lever to the left when a large square was projected and to the right for a small square. These squares and 6 graded squares of intermediate size were presented during test trials, while Ss gripped a dynamometer at 0, 1/6th, and 1/3rd of maximum tension. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded. As predicted, schizophrenics showed a significant decrement at the training stimulus under 1/3rd maximum tension but no decrement at the most remote generalization stimulus with the same dominant response. Nonschizophrenics showed no decrement at any stimuli. Heart rate but not skin conductance showed a significant increase with increased muscle tension in both groups.

Controls demonstrated the largest KFAs. Acute schizophrenics showed less responsivity than normals to proprioceptive stimulation, and chronic schizophrenics manifested the lowest mean KFA score of the 3 groups. Results are discussed as evidence in support of the hypothesis of a proprioceptive deficit in schizophrenia. Results also are interpreted as casting some doubt on the validity of the concept of kinesthetic control of stimulus intensity in schizophrenic size-estimation performance.

Performance on a letter cancellation task under different reinforcement conditions indicated that yielders evidenced maximum performance during the social reinforcement condition and independents performed best during token and monetary reinforcement conditions. Results are interpreted in the context of role theory and the impression-management hypothesis and suggest that patients will engage in behaviors which are reinforced in ways that are congruent with their orientation to the interpersonal world.

AB  - Related body-height perception to T. Lidz's theory of dominance by the mother during the development of the schizophrenic male. Slides were used to compare self-perceptions and perceptions of a maternal figure for 20 normal and 20 chronic undifferentiated schizophrenic males (mean age = 48 yrs). Data support Lidz's postulations; schizophrenics underestimated their own body size and overestimated the size of a maternal figure more than normals. In addition, when a maternal figure and S's own figure were presented simultaneously, schizophrenics underestimated their own perceived body heights more than normals. (15 ref.)

AB  - Hypothesized that (a) an impairment of basic cognitive skills (particularly conservation) differentiates schizophrenics and normals and under-constant and over-constant nonparanoid schizophrenics, and (b) that this and an associated primitive visual centration effect may lead to paradoxical over-constancy for some schizophrenics. 24 male nonparanoid process schizophrenics and 12 normal controls were given a size constancy task. Results confirm that schizophrenics may be both under- and over-constant, and that they exhibit significantly low levels in primitive cognitive operations. The latter abnormalities are particularly marked in over-constant schizophrenics, for whom there is strong evidence of centration with a distant standard. Results suggest that contradictory findings of over- and under-constancy in nonparanoid schizophrenics may be a function of differences in the availability of conserving operations and centration strategies, where the latter would be influenced by characteristics of the experimental display.

AB  - Constructed a test battery designed to evaluate intellectual, verbal, motor, perceptual-motor, and perceptual task performance levels of preschool psychotic children. The battery was used in an experimental comparison of psychotic (11 early schizophrenic, 19 primary autistic, and 35 secondary autistic) and nonpsychotic subnormal (n = 29) children whose CA group means ranged from 56.1-71.8 mo. The comparison involved selected adaptive (nonverbal intellectual and perceptual-motor), verbal, and motor tasks, all also performed by 3 normal Ss. Subnormal Ss were significantly more advanced than the schizophrenic Ss in 2 motor tasks, and than the primary autistic, in all excepting the Seguin formboard and stair climbing. Primary autistic Ss were better at stair climbing than the schizophrenic Ss whose motor performance profiles proved similar to those of lower functioning autistic. The discussion is focused on etiological implications of results. (30 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

The most stable measures not specifically related to the stimulus configuration appeared to be the number of fixations per unit time; measures related to dispersal of looking were unreliable. Data on where S looked, the duration of each fixation and the distance between fixation points appear to follow 1st-order Markov process and the transitional probabilities appear to be individual characteristics stable over time.

No significant group differences were found in the size estimation levels, or when the groups were subdivided on the basis of both premorbid adjustment and paranoid status. All Ss increased their size estimation levels over the 3 trial blocks. The thematic content of the stimuli produced a significant effect in the chronic schizophrenic group, with the nonthreatening scenes being overestimated relative to the threatening scenes. Some methodological problems common to size estimation studies are noted, and the growing inconsistency in the size estimation literature is hypothesized to be due to these problems. (23 ref.)

AB  - 15 17-57 yr. old acute schizophrenics open to perceptual stimuli were receptive to emotional stimuli and intellectually able. Conversely, 35 chronics in the same age range maintaining active internal lives were inattentive to external stimuli. The Petrie procedure appeared uncorrelated with the Silverman kinesthetic figural aftereffect. Results show that overestimation after Petrie large-stimulus interpolation relates to passive behavior; overestimation after small-stimulus interpolation relates to good intellectual and psychological functioning among all, and among chronics to behavioral and conceptual expansiveness.

Paranoids in the chronic poor subgroup exhibited a negative size estimation-drive relationship, considered to be due to reduction in drive which allowed emergence of a functioning perceptual organization that permitted S to attend to the task and show a corresponding increase in size estimation.

AB  - 119 schizophrenics and 56 normal Os judged lengths of lines and preferences for musical excerpts by category rating and magnitude estimation. In the scalings of music preferences, schizophrenic Ss were comparable to normals in their scale forms, inter-scale matching, and intergroup agreement, but their scale range was shortened and constrictive. Individual data showed poor internal consistency and heterogeneity for the schizophrenic Ss in the use of categories and numerals, which presumably accounts for the scale constriction. Data also revealed a high response polarization and perseveration, low average uncertainty, loose category and numeral boundaries, and constrictive use of magnitude. In the scaling of line lengths, such effects were not found, with the exceptions of the low internal consistency and constrictive use of numbers. Observations are related to theoretical formulations on schizophrenia, i.e., paradoxical sensitivity, associative disturbances, and response interferences. (32 ref.)

In Study I, the correlations between the 2 measures occurred in opposite directions for 24 normal males and females; the difference between the correlations for the sexes was statistically significant. In Study II, the same effect was observed in 23 male and female ambulatory schizophrenics. Results of these studies indicate that a perceptual differentiation interpretation of RFT performance is erroneous for certain kinds of Ss. Accurate RFT performance can be achieved by constricting one's field of attention and not responding to background cues. (25 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 1969
AB  - 72 male schizophrenics divided in terms of chronicity, diagnosis, and premorbid adjustment estimated the size of a line embedded in different affective and neutral content. The main result was that premorbid adjustment and chronicity interacted in size-estimation performance with the good, premorbid-adjustment group exhibiting a smaller size estimation in the chronic condition than in the acute, while the poor, premorbid-adjustment group exhibited the opposite effect. Although a Premorbid Adjustment * Chronicity interaction was predicted in previous work, the specific over- or underestimation tendency found for each schizophrenic subgroup differed from those previously predicted. The differences in the present results and predictions derived from a review of the literature are discussed in terms of possible difficulties inherent in making inferences from studies which did not directly control the relevant subject dimensions. Results indicate little support for the social-censure hypothesis and suggest the greater effect of organismic variables relative to stimulus variables in predicting schizophrenic task performance.

Ss were 60 male undergraduates. The results indicated that the tasks were relatively independent although level of anxiety was related to a decrease in performance level on each task. In comparing the 2 discriminative dimensions of angle size and horizontal distance, it was found the horizontal distance was more difficult especially for high-anxiety normals. This result was discussed in terms of the studies with schizophrenics which used discriminative tasks and found more errors on an angular dimension.

AB  - In recent studies it has been inferred from performance on perceptual tasks, that paranoid schizophrenics showed extensive scanning and nonparanoid schizophrenics showed minimal scanning. Eye movements during free-search and size-judgment tasks were recorded for 14 paranoid and 14 nonparanoid schizophrenics, 14 psychotic depressives, and 14 control Ss. Medicated Ss showed lower eyemovement rate and fixation rate than nonmedicated Ss and controls, but there were no significant differences due to schizophrenia. There was a significant interaction between patient type and medication for size-judgment means, but all such differences were reduced to nonsignificance by training. Even after training, Ss showed greater variability in size judgments than controls. Results failed to support the notion of extensive or minimal scanning behavior of schizophrenics. Errors by the psychotic patients in making size judgments were not correlated with scanning behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Attempts to sort out the sources of some of the inconsistent findings in terms of a detailed examination of between-studies differences in task and S variables. It is concluded that acute good premorbid schizophrenics show small but consistent size underestimation. Acute poor premorbid schizophrenics show a small but reliable tendency toward size overestimation. Paranoid schizophrenics underestimate, while nonparanoids overestimate, stimulus size. Among all schizophrenic groups the effects of drug status and relative acuteness or chronicity are at present not well specified. More research on task variables such as memory and viewing time is clearly required. A reanalysis of some previous data indicates that schizophrenics did not differ from normals in perceptual accuracy. The question of attributing differences in size estimation to a sensory process is raised. The present theories of flexibility, scanning, and redundancy do not provide complete explanations of the data. With the relevant variables more precisely identified, progress toward a more complete theory may be made. (28 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 15 good premorbid paranoid acute schizophrenics, 15 poor premorbid nonparanoid acute schizophrenics, and 15 attendants, all males, estimated stimulus paranoid size after receiving (a) 10-sec. and (b) 100-msec. presentations of the standard, also (c) 10-msec. blank flashes instead of the standard. Choices were then made from a group of variable-sized stimuli. As expected, good paranoids, normals, and poor nonparanoids tended to low, intermediate, and high estimation levels, respectively. Contrary to eye-movement interpretation, patient groups differed under the 100-msec. presentation. Lowered estimation level with this presentation suggested stimulus redundancy interpretations. No differences with the blank flash ruled out a simple size-preference response bias. Equal proportions of "hits" among groups indicated that error distributions rather than error frequencies accounted for the results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perceptual differences between normals and schizophrenics revealed by traditional size-constancy experiments are questionable because of S variability, procedural difficulties, and problems inherent in traditional psychophysical methods. A review of the literature reveals few consistent results. The present study compared normals, paranoid schizophrenics, and nonparanoid schizophrenics on a size-constancy task which allowed derivation of additional dependent variables from signal-detection and uncertainty analysis. No group differences were revealed using the size-constancy procedure, but signal-detection analysis indicated nonparanoid schizophrenics were significantly lower in perceptual sensitivity. Uncertainty analysis revealed additional response dispositions characteristic of the schizophrenic groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

These findings are interpreted in terms of the assumption that LSD operates as a primitivizing agent, which is assumed to lessen the definiteness of the boundary of the body in relation to the surroundings." These and other findings are related in discussion to perceptual theory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: The strength of certain visual illusions, including contrast-contrast and apparent motion, is weakened in individuals with schizophrenia. Such phenomena have been interpreted as the impaired integration of inhibitory and excitatory neural responses, and impaired top-down feedback mechanisms. Method(s): To investigate whether and how these factors influence the perceived contrast-contrast and apparent motion illusions in individuals with schizophrenia, we propose a two-layer network, with top-down feedback from layer 2 to layer 1 that can model visual receptive fields (RFs) and their inhibitory and excitatory subfields. Result(s): Our neural model suggests that illusion perception changes in individuals with schizophrenia can be influenced by altered top-down mechanisms and the organization of the on-center off-surround receptive fields. Alteration of the RF inhibitory surround and/or the excitatory center can replicate the difference of illusion precepts between individuals with schizophrenia within certain clinical states and normal controls. The results show that the simulated top-down feedback modulation enlarges the difference of the model illusion representations, replicating the difference between the two groups. Discussion(s): We propose that the heterogeneity of visual and in general sensory processing in certain clinical states of schizophrenia can be largely explained by the degree of top-down feedback reduction, emphasizing the critical role of top-down feedback in illusion perception, and to a lesser extent on the imbalance of excitation/inhibition. Our neural model provides a mechanistic explanation for the modulated visual percepts of contrast-contrast and apparent motion in schizophrenia with findings that can explain a broad range of visual perceptual observations in previous studies. The two-layer motif of the current model provides a general framework that can be tailored to investigate subcortico-cortical (such as thalamocortical) and cortico-cortical networks, bridging neurobiological changes in schizophrenia and perceptual processing.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023 Zhu, Zikopoulos and Yazdanbakhsh.

AB  - Perceptual distortions are core features of psychosis. Weakened surround suppression has been proposed as a neural mechanism of such atypical perceptual experiences. While previous work has measured suppression by asking participants to report the perceived contrast of a low-contrast target surrounded by a high-contrast surround, it is possible to modulate perceived contrast solely by manipulating the orientation of a matched-contrast center and surround. Removing the bottom-up segmentation cue of contrast difference and isolating the orientation-dependent suppression may clarify the neural processes responsible for atypical surround suppression in psychosis. We examined surround suppression across a spectrum of psychotic psychopathology including people with schizophrenia (PSZ; N=31) and bipolar disorder (PBD; N=29), first-degree biological relatives of these patient groups (PBDrel, PSZrel; N=28, N=21, respectively), and healthy controls (N=29). Surround suppression deficits in PSZ, while observable under many stimulus conditions, were absent under the condition that produced the strongest suppression. PBD and PSZrel exhibited intermediate suppression, while PBDrel performed most similarly to controls. Intriguingly, group differences in surround suppression magnitude were moderated by visual acuity. We propose a potential model by which visual acuity and/or focal attention interact with untuned gain control that reproduces the observed pattern of results including the lack of group differences when orientation of center and surround are the same. Our findings further elucidate perceptual mechanisms of impaired center-surround processing in psychosis and provide insights into the effects of visual acuity on orientation-dependent suppression in PSZ.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Visual shape completion is a canonical perceptual organization process that integrates spatially distributed edge information into unified representations of objects. People with schizophrenia show difficulty in discriminating completed shapes but the brain networks and functional connections underlying this perceptual difference remain poorly understood. Also unclear is whether similar neural differences arise in bipolar disorder or vary across the schizo-bipolar spectrum. To address these topics, we scanned (fMRI) people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or no psychiatric illness during rest and during a task in which they discriminated configurations that formed or failed to form completed shapes (illusory and fragmented condition, respectively). Multivariate pattern differences were identified on the cortical surface using 360 predefined parcels and 12 functional networks composed of such parcels. Brain activity flow mapping was used to evaluate the likely involvement of resting-state connections for shape completion. Illusory/fragmented task activation differences ("modulations") in the dorsal attention network (DAN) could distinguish people with schizophrenia (AUCs>.85) and could trans-diagnostically predict cognitive disorganization severity. Activity flow over functional connections from the DAN could predict secondary visual network modulations in each group, except among those with schizophrenia. The secondary visual network was strongly and similarly modulated in each subject group. Task modulations were dispersed over a larger number of networks in patients compared to controls. In summary, abnormal DAN activity emerges during perceptual organization in schizophrenia and may be related to improper attention-related feedback into secondary visual areas. Patients with either disorder may compensate for abnormal perception by relying upon non-visual networks.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To examine this issue, we compared undergraduate students high and low in schizotypal personality traits, reflecting putative liability to psychosis, on two psychophysical tasks assessing local and global stages of the integration process. The Radial Frequency Jittered Orientation Tolerance (RFJOT) task measures tolerance to orientation noise at the local signal level, when judging global stimulus orientation, whilst the Radial Frequency Integration Task (RFIT) measures the ability to globally integrate the local signals that have been extracted during shape discrimination. Positive schizotypy was assessed with the Perceptual Aberration (PAb) scale from the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief. On the RFJOT task, the High PAb group (n = 55) tolerated statistically significantly less noise (d = -0.494) and had a lower proportion of correct responses (d = -0.461) than the Low PAb group (n = 77). For the RFIT there was no statistically significant difference in integration abilities between the High and Low PAb groups. High and Low PAb groups also differed on other positive and disorganized (but not negative) schizotypy traits, hence poorer performance on the RFJOT may not be solely related to unusual perceptual experiences. These findings suggest that difficulties with local noise tolerance but not global integration occur in healthy young adults with high levels of schizotypal personality traits, and may be worth investigating as a marker of risk for schizophrenia.

AB  - Surround suppression was initially identified as a phenomenon at the neural level in which stimuli outside the neuron's receptive field alone cannot activate responses but can modulate neural responses to stimuli covered inside the receptive field. Subsequent studies showed that surround suppression is not only a critical property of neurons across species and brain areas but also has been found in visual perceptions. More importantly, surround suppression varies across individuals and shows significant differences between normal controls and patients with certain mental disorders. Here, we combined results from related literature and summarized the findings derived from physiological and psychophysical evidence. We first outline the basic properties of surround suppression in the visual system and perceptions. Then, we mainly summarize the differences in perceptual surround suppression among different human subjects. Our review suggests that there is no consensus regarding whether the strength of perceptual surround suppression could be used as an effective index to distinguish particular populations. Then, we summarized the similar mechanisms for surround suppression and cognitive impairments to further explore the potential clinical applications of surround suppression. A clearer understanding of the mechanisms of surround suppression in neural responses and perceptions is necessary for facilitating its clinical applications.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Many patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) experience cholinesterase inhibitor-and antipsychoticresistant psychosis. The new second-generation antipsychotic pimavanserin has been used with some success in the treatment of psychosis in other forms of dementia, including Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease dementia. It is possible that pimavanserin may also be useful in the treatment of psychosis in DLB. We sought to describe the disease course and treatment of psychosis in 4 patients with DLB who were prescribed pimavanserin after other medications failed to reduce the frequency or severity of hallucinations and delusions. Case Report: This is a case series of 4 male patients (ages 56 to 74 at the beginning of the reports) who developed DLB and psychosis (eg, visual illusions, visual and olfactory hallucinations, and paranoid delusions). All 4 patients were prescribed cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil or rivastigmine) prior to pimavanserin, and only 1 patient experienced improved psychosis while on cholinesterase inhibitors. All 3 patients who were prescribed first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) or traditional second-generation antipsychotics (eg, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine) experienced initial or lasting side effects with no improvement of psychosis. Conversely, all 4 patients tolerated pimavanserin well, and 3 of the 4 patients experienced significant improvement of psychosis (eg, fewer hallucinations, fewer delusions, reduced paranoia, and/or reduced distress or agitation related to hallucinations and delusions) when prescribed pimavanserin. Conclusion(s): This case series suggests that pimavanserin is tolerable in older males with DLB and that it may be useful for the reduction of distressful hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia in patients with DLB.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023, International Scientific Information, Inc..

AB  - Research supports abnormal inhibitory visual motion processing in adults with remitted and current depression, but all studies to date have used paradigms with simple grating stimuli. Global motion processing, where multiple motion signals must be integrated, has not been explored in depression, nor have inhibitory processes within that domain. Depressed participants (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 28) completed a direction discrimination task featuring a random dot pattern stimulus. Various signal (rightward or leftward dots) to noise (dots with randomly assigned directions) ratios modulated task difficulty. Metrics of global center surround suppression and facilitation were calculated. Accuracy in the baseline condition (i.e., no surrounding annulus) was not significantly different between depressed and healthy participants. Global center surround suppression and facilitation were not significantly different between healthy and depressed participants overall. When limiting the sample to unmedicated individuals, depressed participants (n = 27) showed a reduced global center surround suppression effect compared to controls, and there was no difference in global center surround facilitation. While global motion processing is intact in depression, abnormal center surround suppression effects in depression do extend to global motion stimuli. These alterations may be mitigated by the psychotropic medications taken by some subjects in our depressed sample. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying these effects.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023 Murray, Norton.

DO  - NA

AB  - Presentation Description : Phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (OCT) measures functional changes in the human retina by detecting temporal variations in the phase of the backscattered waves. By parallelizing both lateral and axial data acquisition, full-field swept-source OCT (FF-SS-OCT) provides particularly robust phase stability of retinal images. Using this FF-SS-OCT to detect functional phase changes thus allows the detection of minute morphological changes in the single-digit nanometer range. Due to the tomographic nature of the imaging method, the changes can be assigned to lateral and axial structures of the retina with micrometer accuracy. Thus, it is possible to detect the functional changes of different cell layers simultaneously and to investigate their functional connectivity. Using FF-SS-OCT, it was possible to measure reproducible results in the photoreceptors and the inner plexiform layer (IPL), allowing us to investigate the connection between the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells. In addition, the functional contributions of phase changes from different sub-layers of the IPL were also separated, enabling us to differentiate the functional contribution of different bipolar/ganglion cell types. For example, a clear sensitivity to flicker stimulation is observed in the central sub-layer of the IPL, whereas the other sub-layers show no change for flickering lights. The high lateral resolution also allows the observation of signal processing steps of the retinal neurons, for example, the center-surround processing of the receptive fields. So far, we investigated these functional signals in a small group of healthy volunteers aged 26 to 60 years and showed high quantitative reproducibility for each subject and qualitative reproducibility between subjects.

AB  - How does schizophrenia affect art making processes and the artwork that results from these processes? Here we discuss research dealing with this question, focusing on pictorial art, and applying ideas and methods from vision science. We briefly review the study of art by people with schizophrenia, focusing on Hans Prinzhorn's application of Art Historical analysis to images. However, we argue that more quantitative methods are needed, which can be drawn from modern vision science. This approach is potentiated by the fact that there is considerable and growing evidence for deep relationships between specific patterns of visual dysfunction and the neural substrates and patient experience of schizophrenia. At the same time, images produced by artists with schizophrenia provide a unique window on the disorder and its sensory-perceptual effects. The goal is to unite these spheres of inquiry. There is evidence of effects of vision abnormalities associated with schizophrenia in art produced by people with the disorder. We also briefly discuss art appreciation in schizophrenia in the context of visual deficits. We then provide a case study of an artist with schizophrenia, Henry Cockburn, in order to give first-hand experience of artistic expression in schizophrenia. Bearing in mind potential pitfalls, we conclude by encouraging researchers to pursue systematic studies of visual art production-as well as the proclivity to make art-in schizophrenia in order to illuminate both patients' perceptual experience and the neural underpinnings of the disorder.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Anomalies of attentional selection have been repeatedly described in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, a precise analysis of their ability to inhibit irrelevant visual information during attentional selection is not documented. Recent behavioral as well as neurophysiological and computational evidence showed that attentional search among different competing stimuli elicits an area of suppression in the immediate surrounding of the attentional focus. In the present study, the strength and spatial extension of this surround suppression were tested in individuals with schizophrenia and neurotypical controls. Participants were asked to report the orientation of a visual "pop-out" target, which appeared in different positions within a peripheral array of non-target stimuli. In half of the trials, after the target appeared, a probe circle circumscribed a non-target stimulus at various target-to-probe distances; in this case, participants were asked to report the probe orientation instead. Results suggest that, as compared to neurotypical controls, individuals with schizophrenia showed stronger and spatially more extended filtering of visual information in the areas surrounding their attentional focus. This increased filtering of visual information outside the focus of attention might potentially hamper their ability to integrate different elements into coherent percepts and influence higher order behavioral, affective, and cognitive domains.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Working memory (WM) impairments are well recognized in schizophrenia patients (PSZ) and contribute to poor psycho-social outcomes in this population. Distinct neural networks underlay the ability to encode and recall visual and spatial information raising the possibility that profile of visual working memory performance may help pinpoint dysfunctional neural correlates in schizophrenia. This study assessed the resolution and associative aspects of visual working memory deficits in schizophrenia and whether these deficits arise during encoding or maintenance processes. A total of 60 participants (30 PSZ and 30 healthy controls) matched in age, gender and education assessed on a modified object in place (OiPT), a delayed non-match-to-sample (DNMST) and a delayed spatial estimation (DSET) task. Patients demonstrated lower accuracy than controls in binding visual features of the same object and recognizing novel objects as well as lower precision recalling the location of a memorized target. Moreover, response choice set size affected recognition accuracy more in PSZ than controls. However, delay duration affected spatial recall precisions, binding, and recognition accuracy equally in the two groups. Our results suggest that visual working memory (vWM) impairments in schizophrenia predominantly reflect spatial and non-spatial binding deficits, with largely preserved discrete feature information. Moreover, these impairments likely arise more during encoding than during maintenance. These binding deficits may reflect impaired effective neural functional connectivity observed in schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023 The Authors

AB  - Well characterised cognitive and perceptual impairments in schizophrenia may not be diagnostically specific with some studies suggesting no significant differences between psychotic disorders. This transdiagnostic ambiguity is paralleled in the boundary distinctions between psychotic disorders and the sub-threshold symptomatology of schizotypy. The current study used the CNTRACS test battery to explore if performance deficits in visual integration, relational memory and goal maintenance were specific to schizophrenia or extend to other psychotic disorders; and if task performance varied between individuals with schizophrenia and schizotypy in healthy adults. The sample consisted of healthy controls, and patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders and non-psychotic disorders who were tested in person; and an online sample of self-assessed healthy adults. No significant differences were found in performance between patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in contrast to non-psychotic disorders and healthy controls. The high schizotypy group performed better on the tasks compared to the other psychoses and schizophrenia groups. There were no differences in the healthy control group between individuals with high versus low schizotypy or between in-person and online task performance. These findings support the notion that cognitive and perceptual impairments in schizophrenia extend to other psychotic disorders but are discontinuous with schizotypy. This study provides insights into similarities between schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders with regards to the potential neural substrates underpinning these functions and supports the use of online tools for assessing domains of cognition and perception.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022 The Authors

AB  - Schizophrenia patients are known to have deficits in contextual vision. However, results are often very mixed. In some paradigms, patients do not take the context into account and, hence, perform more veridically than healthy controls. In other paradigms, context deteriorates performance much more strongly in patients compared to healthy controls. These mixed results may be explained by differences in the paradigms as well as by small or biased samples, given the large heterogeneity of patients' deficits. Here, we show that mixed results may also come from idiosyncrasies of the stimuli used because in variants of the same visual paradigm, tested with the same participants, we found intact and deficient processing.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022

AB  - Disturbances in self-monitoring are core symptoms of schizophrenia. Some research suggests an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues and a reduced weighting of self-generated interoceptive signals to guide perception. The vestibular sense provides important self-generated information about the body in space. Alterations of vestibular function are reported in schizophrenia, but it is unknown whether internally generated vestibular information is discounted in favour of exteroceptive input. In this study, we test for evidence of an over-reliance on exteroceptive visual cues and a reduced weighting of vestibular signals in guiding perception. In a group of individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, we used a well-studied visual illusion - the Tilt Illusion - to probe the respective weight given to visual and vestibular cues in judging line orientation. The Tilt Illusion reveals that perceived orientation of a vertical grating is biased by the orientation in its surround. This illusion increases when the head is tilted, due to the reduced reliability of vestibular information that would otherwise provide an internally generated reference for vertical. We predicted that an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues in schizophrenia would lead to a reduced susceptibility to the effects of head position on Tilt Illusion strength. We find no difference between patients and controls. Both groups show comparable Tilt Illusion magnitudes that increase when the head is tilted. Thus, our findings suggest that chronic patients with schizophrenia adequately combine self-generated vestibular cues and exteroceptive visual input to judge line verticality. A stronger reliance on exteroceptive information over internally generated signals in guiding perception is not evident in our data. Deficits in self-monitoring might therefore be modality specific or state dependant.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022

AB  - Speech perception used to be seen as a solely an auditory phenomenon until the discovery of the "McGurk Effect" and in recent decades it has come to be understood as a multimodal, specifically, an auditory-visual process. Behavioural studies have shown that the magnitude of auditory-visual integration shows differences across ages and languages. A new question regarding the integration of auditory and visual speech information pertains to the case of mental disorders - a domain in which a significant paucity of data exits. The available studies (e.g., schizophrenic patients) generally point out to lessened levels of integration on both behavioural and cortical levels in respective clinical populations. A recent study with bipolar disordered individuals has shown that while those in manic and depressive episodes give similar behavioural responses to McGurk stimuli revealing an integration of auditory and visual speech information similar to the control group. However, in a visual-only condition (i.e., lipreading), compared to the control group and manic episode patients, those in the depressive episode show very impoverished levels of lipreading. We hypothesize that, during depressive episode of bipolar patients, abnormal lipreading is associated with impaired occipito-temporal connections in the dominant hemisphere, which are compensated by early activation of anterior cingulate gyrus and IFG, either through dominant or non-dominant hemisphere pathways. This can relay the signal in reverse fashion to the multimodal procession areas like posterior superior temporal sulcus, hence allowing audiovisual integration. This finding calls for cortical imaging studies to unearth the physiological processes involved in both lipreading and auditory-visual speech processing in the bipolar disordered individuals. A full understanding of these processes will provide practitioners with secondary diagnostic tools and knowledge regarding this disorder.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021

AB  - Visual deficits are core deficits of schizophrenia. Classically, deficits are determined with demanding psychophysical tasks requiring fine-grained spatial or temporal resolution. Less is known about holistic processing. Here, we employed the Leuven Embedded Figures Test (L-EFT) measuring classic aspects of Gestalt processing. A target shape is embedded in a context and observers have to detect as quickly as possible in which display the target is embedded. Targets vary in closure, symmetry, complexity, and good continuation. In all conditions, schizophrenia patients had longer RTs compared to controls and depressive patients and to a lesser extent compared to their siblings. There was no interaction suggesting that, once the main deficit of schizophrenia patients is discarded, there are no further deficits in Gestalt perception between the groups. This result is in line with a growing line of research showing that when schizophrenia patients are given sufficient time to accomplish the task, they perform as well as controls.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021

AB  - The latest COVID-19 pandemic reveals that unexpected changes elevate depression bringing people apart, but also calling for social sharing. Yet the impact of depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of poor sensitivity to social signals. This has implications for mental well-being under the current pandemic conditions.Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Upside-down reversal of vision (UDRV) is a rare form of metamorphopsia, or visual illusions that can distort the size, shape or inclination of objects. This phenomenon is paroxysmal and transient in nature, with patients reporting a sudden inversion of vision in the coronal plane, which typically remains for seconds or minutes, though occasionally persists for hours or days, before returning to normal. Distorted egocentric orientation (ie, the patient perceives the body to be tilted away from the vertical plane) is even more rare as a co-occurring phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a veteran who presented with UDRV and distorted egocentric orientation during hospitalisation on an inpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation setting following an elective hip surgery. This case serves not only to document the presence of rare visual illusions, but also illustrates the importance and value of an interdisciplinary team approach.Copyright <c2><a9> BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

AB  - Introduction Integrating visual and auditory information during gesture-speech integration (GSI) is important for successful social communication, which is often impaired in schizophrenia. Several studies suggested the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) to be a relevant multisensory integration site. However, intact STS activation patterns were often reported in patients. Thus, here we used Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to analyze whether information processing in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) is impaired during GSI on network level. Methods We investigated GSI in three different samples. First, we replicated a recently published connectivity model for GSI in a healthy subject group (n = 19). Second, we investigated differences between patients with SSD and a matched healthy control group (n = 17 each). Participants were presented videos of an actor performing intrinsically meaningful gestures accompanied by spoken sentences in German or Russian, or just telling a German sentence without gestures. Results Across all groups, fMRI analyses revealed similar activation patterns, and DCM analyses resulted in the same winning model for GSI. This finding directly replicates previous results. However, patients revealed significantly reduced connectivity in the verbal pathway (from left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) to left STS). The clinical significance of this connection is supported by its correlations with the severity of concretism and a subscale of negative symptoms (SANS). Conclusion Our model confirms the importance of the pSTS as integration site during audio-visual integration. Patients showed generally intact connectivity during GSI, but revealed impaired information transfer via the verbal pathway. This might be the basis of interpersonal communication problems in patients with SSD.

AB  - Background/Objective: Patients with schizophrenia not only have psychiatric symptoms, but also have movement problems, which might also be associated with their reduced quality of life. Little is known about how to improve their movement performance for patients. Manipulating object size and distance is common in occupational therapy practice to evaluate and optimize reaching performance in patients with physical disabilities, but effects of the manipulation in patients with schizophrenia remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine whether object size and distance could change performance of reaching kinematics in patients with mild schizophrenia. Method(s): Twenty-nine patients with mild schizophrenia and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were required to reach for, as quickly as possible, a small or large object that was placed at a near or far distance. We measured movement time, peak velocity, path length ratio, percentage of time to peak velocity, and movement units to infer movement speed, forcefulness, spatial efficiency (directness), control strategies, and smoothness. Result(s): Patients' reaching movements were slower (p =.017) and less direct (p =.007) than those of controls. A larger object induced faster (p =.016), more preprogrammed (p =.018), and more forceful (p =.010) movements in patients. A farther object induced slower, more feedback dependent, but more forceful and more direct movements (all p <.001). Conclusion(s): The results of kinematic deficiencies suggest the need of movement training for patients with mild schizophrenia. Occupational therapists may grade or adapt reaching activities by changing object size and distance to enhance movement performance in patients with schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Several studies have investigated cognition in bipolar disorder (BPD), but there is a large gap in the literature with regard to visual processing in BPD. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is one of the main measures that is used to verify and describe spatial processing responses and their mechanisms. The present article describes a retrospective case series and literature review of the presentation and outcome of visual processing in BPD. Our series included 5 patients with Type I BPD, 22- to 41-years-old. None of the patients had a history of neurological or cardiovascular disease, head trauma, chronic contact with such substances as organic solvents, or current or prior drug abuse. They also did not present comorbidities. None of the patients had ocular disease, based on fundoscopic and optical coherence tomography examinations. Patients with BPD had lower CSF at low and high spatial frequencies when compared with a nonclinic group. Further control studies are needed to confirm or refute the assumption that BPD affects visual processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perceptual organization (PO) difficulties have repeatedly been reported in people with schizophrenia, and in healthy individuals with high levels of schizotypy traits, who are at increased risk for schizophrenia. In particular, poor performance on the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) has been interpreted as an atypically strong preference for global over local processing, even though these processes cannot be clearly disambiguated on this test. Here we use two separate versions of the Radial Frequency Search Task (RFST), a new index of PO abilities, to selectively investigate global and local processing of shape information in trait schizotypy. Schizotypy traits were assessed using the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief. Individuals selected for high and low levels of positive schizotypy [assessed with the Wisconsin Schizotypy Scales-Brief Perceptual Aberration (PAb) scale] completed the EFT, along with the Global RFST and the Local RFST, all of which require participants to find a target shape amongst distractor elements. The High PAb group (n = 83) were less efficient (i.e., reactions times slowed more as the set size increased) than the Low PAb group (n = 146) on the Global RFST (significant group differences for Target Absent conditions only), but not the Local RFST. High and Low PAb groups also differed on other schizotypy traits, so the specificity of the results to positive schizotypy cannot be assured. Unexpectedly, no group differences were observed on the EFT; however, there was a small, but significant, positive correlation between RFST search efficiency and EFT performance, indicating that they shared some common processes. Overall, the pattern of results suggests that global (but not local) processing difficulties may be contributing to the poorer perceptual organization observed in groups with high levels of schizotypy traits. In addition, the confinement of this result to the Target Absent condition suggests that the underlying mechanism involves differences in decisional processes on the RFST between high and low schizotypy groups. The RFST shows promise as a useful tool for measuring specific perceptual organization abilities in non-clinical, and potentially clinical, samples.

AB  - Social neuroscience offers a wide range of techniques that may be applied to study the social cognitive deficits that may underlie reduced social functioning-a common feature across many psychiatric disorders. At the same time, a significant proportion of research in this area has been conducted using paradigms that utilize static displays of faces or eyes. The use of point-light displays (PLDs) offers a viable alternative for studying recognition of emotion or intention inference while minimizing the amount of information presented to participants. This mini-review aims to summarize studies that have used PLD to study emotion and intention processing in schizophrenia (SCZ), affective disorders, anxiety and personality disorders, eating disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the reviewed studies: first, the social cognitive problems found in most of the psychiatric samples using PLD were of smaller magnitude than those found in studies presenting social information using faces or voices. Second, even though the information presented in PLDs is extremely limited, presentation of these types of stimuli is sufficient to elicit the disorder-specific, social cognitive biases (e.g., mood-congruent bias in depression, increased threat perception in anxious individuals, aberrant body size perception in eating disorders) documented using other methodologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that point-light stimuli may be a useful method of studying social information processing in psychiatry. At the same time, some limitations of using this methodology are also outlined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A total of 75 patients were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders-Revised as having dissociative identity disorder (DID), and 100 patients were diagnosed with the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality as having borderline personality disorder (BPD). Both groups were administered the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation (MID). DID patients had significantly higher MID scores than BPD patients, different distributions of MID scores, and different MID subscale profiles in 3 ranges of MID scores (0-15, 15-30, 30-45). The core MID symptoms-exhibited at all ranges of MID scores-for DID patients (the presence of alters, identity confusion, and memory problems) and BPD patients (flashbacks, identity confusion, and memory problems) were ostensibly similar but were considered to be mostly produced by different underlying processes. Multiple regression analyses showed that the core MID symptoms of DID patients had different predictors than did the core MID symptoms of BPD patients. Alter identities seemed to generate most-but not all-dissociative phenomena in DID patients, whereas only the 24% highest scoring BPD patients (MID >=45) seemed to manifest alter-driven dissociative experiences. Most BPD dissociative experiences appeared to be due to 5 other mechanisms: (a) BPD-specific, stress-driven, rapid shifts of self-state; (b and c) nondefensive disruptions of the framework of perceptual organization with or without an accompanying BPD-specific, dissociation-like disintegration of affective/neurocognitive functioning; (d) a defensive distancing or detachment from distress (i.e., simple depersonalization); and (e) Allen, Console, and Lewis's (1999) severe absorptive detachment.Copyright <c2><a9> 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of parietal and occipital cortices related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and the magnitude of the illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition. Across individuals, we observed selective correlations between the level of GABA and the magnitude of contextual illusion. Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a regionand feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Parietal and occipital cortices contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections. We propose that these lateral connections may underlie the selective influence of GABA on visual perception.Copyright <c2><a9> 2017 Song, Sandberg et al.

AB  - Purpose: In this ongoing study we are using flash and pattern electroretinography (fERG and pERG) to clarify the contributions of retinal signaling abnormalities to previously reported changes in contrast sensitivity, visual acuity, and contour integration in people with schizophrenia. Method(s): Data were collected on 24 patients and 25 age-matched healthy controls. fERG data were collected under both light- and dark-adapted conditions, using a range of flash intensities, backgrounds, and temporal frequencies. The primary fERG variables of interest were a-wave activity (reflecting photoreceptor response), b-wave activity (reflecting primarily bipolar cell activity) and the photopic negative response (PhNR) (reflecting ganglion cell activity). The primary pERG variables of interest were magnitude, magnitude D, and the magnitude D/magnitude ratio for low and high contrast stimuli. Result(s): On photopic fERG tests, schizophrenia patients demonstrated significantly weaker photoreceptor response when a flash was presented against an unlit background (p<.05), and during a steady-state flicker test (p<.005). On scotopic tests, the rate of response gain per unit of intensity increase was significantly weaker for patients than controls (group x condition interaction p=.001). In both light- and dark-adapted conditions, patients demonstrated weaker signaling of bipolar cells (ps <.005). The schizophrenia group was also characterized by a weaker PhNR (p<.05). Multiple tests' a- and b- wave amplitudes were related to behavioral contrast sensitivity impairments in the schizophrenia group (ps <.05 or.001), but not to visual acuity or contour integration. The groups did not differ significantly on pERG variables. For patients only, significant relationships were observed between poorer contour integration and reduced pERG amplitudes and longer latencies (all ps either <.05 or.001). For controls only, higher pERG values were related to better near and far visual acuity (ps <.05 or.01). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that both reduced signaling of photoreceptor and bipolar cells, as well as attenuated response gain, are associated with schizophrenia. Both rod and cone responses appear to be affected, and these changes may be related to the contrast sensitivity reduction in this group. The issue of ganglion cell function in schizophrenia is less clear, but its relationships to contour integration warrant further study.

AB  - Objectives: The goals of this study are to follow up on offspring of subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD) whose neurocognitive characteristics were already assessed in a previous cross-sectional study and to identify shared characteristics between offspring of both disorders. Method(s): The presentation includes a longitudinal study in which children and adolescent offspring of parents with schizophrenia (HRs) or BD (HRb) were evaluated two years after the first assessment. Three groups of subjects were included as follows: 41 HRs, 90 HRb, and 107 offspring of parents without any psychotic or bipolar disorder (CC). Children and adolescents were assessed using the structured interview, Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL). A neuropsychological battery was also carried out, including the following cognitive domains: intelligence, working memory, processing speed, logical memory, verbal learning, visual memory, perceptual organization, executive functions, and sustained attention. A mixed-model analysis was performed to test whether there were significant differences between groups in any of the cognitive variables. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, psychopathology, and IQ were taken into account in the analysis. Result(s): Significant differences between groups were found in working memory (F = 8.189; P = 0.023), processing speed (F = 13.470; P < 0.001), intelligence (F = 5.374; P = 0.005), verbal learning (F = 3.968; P = 0.020), and visual memory (F = 11.481; P < 0.001) at baseline and at two-year follow-up. Specifically, the post hoc analysis revealed that HRs scored lower than CC control subjects in all of these areas. Moreover, HRs subjects also showed more difficulties than HRb subjects in working memory, processing speed, and intelligence. Interestingly, significant differences were observed between HRb and CC only in processing speed. No significant differences were found between the baseline and the two-year follow-up assessment. No interactions time x group were observed in any cognitive variable. Conclusion(s): Children and adolescents at high risk for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have more cognitive difficulties than CC. Difficulties observed in processing speed seemto be shared by both high-risk groups but weremoremarked in the HRs than in the HRb group. HRs showed low scores in more cognitive areas than HRb. Cognitive difficulties were stable over time in this study.

AB  - Chloroquine is a prototype antimalarial drug, widely used in several branches of medicine. Antimalarial drugs are used in the treatment of various dermatological, immunological, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Examples of off-labelled indications for chloroquine analogues use include dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, polymorphous light eruption, disseminated granuloma annulare and porfiria cutanea tarda. There is a relatively small number of adverse effects related to chloroquine analogues used in standard doses, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headaches, skin reactions, hypotension, convulsions, extrapyramidal symptoms and visual disturbances. Psychiatric side effects of chloroquine seem to be rare, but may manifest in a wide range of symptoms, such as confusion, disorientation, ideas of persecution, agitation, outbursts of violence, loss of interest, feeling sad, suicidal ideas and impaired insight. There is also a report of a manic episode with psychotic features in the course of bipolar disorder, and another case report of persecutory delusions, anxiety, derealisation and visual illusions triggered by chloroquine. The duration of psychiatric symptoms usually ranges from one to two weeks, and symptoms usually disappear within several days following cessation of chloroquine usage and starting psychiatric treatment where indicated. This article reviews the case studies of patients diagnosed with mental disorders resulting from the use of chloroquine, and discusses the management in such cases.Copyright <c2><a9> Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between psychometrically-defined schizotypy and the ability to detect a visual target pattern. Target detection is typically impaired by a surrounding pattern (context) with an orientation that is parallel to the target, relative to a surrounding pattern with an orientation that is orthogonal to the target (orientation-dependent contextual modulation). Based on reports that this effect is reduced in those with schizophrenia, we hypothesised that there would be a negative relationship between the relative score on psychometrically-defined schizotypy and the relative effect of orientation-dependent contextual modulation. We measured visual contrast detection thresholds and scores on the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE) from a non-clinical sample (N = 100). Contrary to our hypothesis, we find an absence of a monotonic relationship between the relative magnitude of orientation-dependent contextual modulation of visual contrast detection and the relative score on any of the subscales of the O-LIFE. The apparent difference of this result with previous reports on those with schizophrenia suggests that orientation-dependent contextual modulation may be an informative condition in which schizophrenia and psychometrically-defined schizotypy are dissociated. However, further research is also required to clarify the strength of orientationdependent contextual modulation in those with schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2017 Mannion et al.

AB  - The power of SNP association studies to detect valid relationships with clinical phenotypes in schizophrenia is largely limited by the number of SNPs selected and non-specificity of phenotypes. To address this, we first assessed performance on two visual perceptual organization tasks designed to avoid many generalized deficit confounds, Kanizsa shape perception and contour integration, in a schizophrenia patient sample. Then, to reduce the total number of candidate SNPs analyzed in association with perceptual organization phenotypes, we employed a two-stage strategy: first a priori SNPs from three candidate genes were selected (GAD1, NRG1 and DTNBP1); then a Hierarchical Classes Analysis (HICLAS) was performed to reduce the total number of SNPs, based on statistically related SNP clusters. HICLAS reduced the total number of candidate SNPs for subsequent phenotype association analyses from 6 to 3. MANCOVAs indicated that rs10503929 and rs1978340 were associated with the Kanizsa shape perception filling in metric but not the global shape detection metric. rs10503929 was also associated with altered contour integration performance. SNPs not selected by the HICLAS model were unrelated to perceptual phenotype indices. While the contribution of candidate SNPs to perceptual impairments requires further clarification, this study reports the first application of HICLAS as a hypothesis-independent mathematical method for SNP data reduction. HICLAS may be useful for future larger scale genotype-phenotype association studies.Copyright <c2><a9> 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The visual environment of humans contains abundant ambiguity and fragmentary information. Therefore, an early step of vision must disambiguate the incessant stream of information. Humorous stimuli produce a situation that is strikingly analogous to this process: Funniness is associated with the incongruity contained in a joke, pun, or cartoon. Like in vision in general, appreciating a visual pun as funny necessitates disambiguation of incongruous information. Therefore, perceived funniness of visual puns was implemented to study visual perception in a sample of 36 schizophrenia patients and 56 healthy control participants. We found that both visual incongruity and Theory of Mind (ToM) content of the puns were associated with increased experienced funniness. This was significantly less so in participants with schizophrenia, consistent with the gestalt hypothesis of schizophrenia, which would predict compromised perceptual organization in patients. The association of incongruity with funniness was not mediated by known predictors of humor appreciation, such as affective state, depression, or extraversion. Patients with higher excitement symptoms and, at a trend level, reduced cognitive symptoms, reported lower funniness experiences. An open question remained whether patients showed this deficiency of visual incongruity detection independent of their ToM deficiency. Humorous stimuli may be viewed as a convenient method to study perceptual processes, but also fundamental questions of higher-level cognition.Copyright <c2><a9> 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Visual perception by individuals with schizophrenia has not been extensively researched. The focus of this review is the perception of physiological visual illusions by patients with schizophrenia, a differences of perception reported in a small number of studies. Increased or decreased susceptibility of these patients to various illusions seems to be unconnected to the location of origin in the visual apparatus, which also takes place in illusions connected to other modalities. The susceptibility of patients with schizophrenia to haptic illusions has not yet been investigated, although the need for such investigation has been is clear. The emerging picture is that some individuals with schizophrenia are "resistant" to some of the illusions and are able to assess visual phenomena more "rationally", yet certain illusions (ex. Muller-Lyer's) are perceived more intensely. Disturbances in the perception of visual illusions have neither been classified as possible diagnostic indicators of a dangerous mental condition, nor included in the endophenotype of schizophrenia. Although the relevant data are sparse, the ability to replicate the results is limited, and the research model lacks a "gold standard", some preliminary conclusions may be drawn. There are indications that disturbances in visual perception are connected to the extent of disorganization, poor initial social functioning, poor prognosis, and the types of schizophrenia described as neurodevelopmental. Patients with schizophrenia usually fail to perceive those illusions that require volitional controlled attention, and show lack of sensitivity to the contrast between shape and background.

AB  - Schizophrenia is increasingly being viewed as a "whole brain" disorder with deficits affecting widespread cortical and subcortical networks. Within this context, studies of visual cortical function may be particularly important both because visual processing deficits directly affect social and occupational function and because these systems are well characterized at the basic science level, permitting informative translational research. This article summarizes a conference on visual processing dysfunction in schizophrenia held in Lausanne, Switzerland from June 30 to July 1, 2014 and introduces this special issue. Speakers focused on multiple aspects of visual dysfunction in schizophrenia using behavioral, neurophysiological and fMRI-based approaches.Four main themes emerged. First was a focus on response disturbances within the early visual system, using paradigms such as sensory EEG and MEG-based responses. Second, behavioral deficits were noted in processing related to local interaction within visual regions, using paradigms such as Vernier acuity or contour integration. These deficits provided potential model systems to understand impaired connectivity within the brain in schizophrenia more generally.Third, several visual measures were found to correlate highly with symptoms and/or neurocognitive processing. Deficits in contour integration, for example, correlated highly with conceptual disorganization, whereas perceptual instability correlated with delusion formation. These findings highlight links between perceptual-level disturbance and clinical manifestation. Finally, the potential involvement of specific neurotransmitter receptors, including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors and alpha7 nicotinic receptors were discussed as potential etiological mechanisms. Overall, the meeting highlighted the contributions of visual pathway dysfunction to the etiopathogenesis of neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - F-BAR proteins function in diverse cellular processes by linking membranes to the actin cytoskeleton. Multiple F-BAR domains are able to bend membranes into thin tubules through oligomerization. However, it is unknown if F-BAR domain oligomerization universally leads to membrane bending, or even if F-BAR oligomerization is important for physiological function. Here we investigate the mechanisms of oligomerization of two cytokinetic Schizosaccharomyces pombe F-BARs as well as multiple previously untested human F-BARs. We find that S. pombe Imp2 is able to tubulate membranes, while S. pombe Cdc15 and 6 human F-BAR domains including those from Fer and RhoGAP4, despite the ability to oligomerize, do not induce membrane tubules. We determined structurally how Cdc15, Imp2, Fer, and RhoGAP4 oligomerize: Imp2 forms helical oligomers that underlie its tubulation activity, Cdc15 forms linear tip-to-tip oligomers, and Fer and RhoGAP4 form oligomers through lateral interactions. We then tested the importance of oligomerization on each protein's function with specific mutations blocking oligomerization. Surprisingly, the oligomerization and tubulation activities of Imp2 were dispensable for its function during cytokinesis. Linear tip-to-tip oligomerization by Cdc15, on the other hand, was critical for high avidity membrane binding and the formation of a stable cytokinetic scaffold at the division site to prevent contractile ring sliding. Oligomerization by the human Fer and RhoGAP4 FBAR domains was also critical for each proteins' function in cell migration. We conclude that diverse modes of F-BAR oligomerization are critical for the cellular function of F-BAR domains beyond tubulating membranes.

AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia show overconfidence in memory and social cognition errors. The present investigation examined whether this cognitive distortion also manifests in perceptual tasks. Method(s): A total of 55 individuals with schizophrenia, 58 with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as well as 45 non-clinical controls were presented 24 blurry black and white pictures, half of which contained a hidden object; the other half contained ("snowy") visual noise. Participants had to judge whether the pictures depicted an object or not and how confident they were in this judgment. Result(s): Participants with schizophrenia showed overconfidence in errors and an enhanced knowledge corruption index (i.e. rate of high-confident errors on all high-confident responses) relative to both control groups. In contrast, accuracy scores did not differ between clinical groups. Metacognitive parameters were correlated with self-rated levels of current paranoia. Discussion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate overconfidence in errors among individuals with psychosis using a visual perception task. Speaking to the specificity of this abnormality for schizophrenia and its pathogenetic relevance, overconfidence in errors and knowledge corruption were elevated in patients with schizophrenia relative to both control groups and were correlated with paranoia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Illusion, namely a mismatch between the objective and perceived properties of an object present in the environment, is a common feature of visual perception, both in normal and pathological conditions. This makes illusion a valuable tool with which to explore normal perception and its impairments. Although still debated, the hypothesis of a modified, and typically diminished, susceptibility to illusions in schizophrenia patients is supported by a growing number of studies. The current paper aimed to review how illusions have been used to explore and reveal the core features of visual perception in schizophrenia from a psychophysical, neurophysiological and functional point of view. We propose an integration of these findings into a common hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. The Bayesian formalism considers perception as the optimal combination between sensory evidence and prior knowledge, thereby highlighting the interweaving of perceptions and beliefs. Notably, it offers a holistic and convincing explanation for the perceptual changes observed in schizophrenia that might be ideally tested using illusory paradigms, as well as potential paths to explore neural mechanisms. Implications for psychopathology (in terms of positive symptoms, subjective experience or behavior disruptions) are critically discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anatomical and physiological approaches are beginning to reveal the synaptic origins of parallel ON- and OFF-pathway retinal circuits for the transmission of short (S-) wavelength sensitive cone signals in the primate retina. Anatomical data suggest that synaptic output from S-cones is largely segregated; central elements of synaptic triads arise almost exclusively from the "blue-cone" bipolar cell, a presumed ON bipolar, whereas triad-associated contacts derive primarily from the "flat" midget bipolar cell, a hyperpolarizing, OFF bipolar. Similarly, horizontal cell connectivity is also segregated, with only the H2 cell-type receiving numerous contacts from S-cones. Negative feedback from long (L-) and middle (M-) wavelength sensitive cones via the H2 horizontal cells elicits an antagonistic surround in S-cones demonstrating that S versus L + M or "blue-yellow" opponency is first established in the S-cone. However, the S-cone output utilizes distinct synaptic mechanisms to create color opponency at the ganglion cell level. The blue-cone bipolar cell is presynaptic to the small bistratified, "blue-ON" ganglion cell. S versus L + M cone opponency arises postsynaptically by converging S-ON and LM-OFF excitatory bipolar inputs to the ganglion cell's bistratified dendritic tree. The common L + M cone surrounds of the parallel S-ON and LM-OFF cone bipolar inputs appear to cancel resulting in "blue-yellow" antagonism without center-surround spatial opponency. By contrast, in midget ganglion cells, opponency arises by the differential weighting of cone inputs to the receptive field center versus surround. In the macula, the "private-line" connection from a midget ganglion cell to a single cone predicts that S versus L + M opponency is transmitted from the S-cone to the S-OFF midget bipolar and ganglion cell. Beyond the macula, OFF-midget ganglion cell dendritic trees enlarge and collect additional input from multiple L and M cones. Thus S-OFF opponency via the midget pathway would be expected to become more complex in the near retinal periphery as L and/or M and S cone inputs sum to the receptive field center. An important goal for further investigation will be to explore the hypothesis that distinct bistratified S-ON versus midget S-OFF retinal circuits are the substrates for human psychophysical detection mechanisms attributed to S-ON versus S-OFF perceptual channels.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the spatial resolution of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) response to subretinal stimulation with photovoltaic arrays. Method(s): Photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes of 70 and 140pm were placed on the photoreceptor side of normally-sighted (Long Evans, LE) and degenerate (Royal College of Surgeons, RCS) rat retinas, while network-meDiated responses were recorded from the RGCs using a 512 channel multielectrode array. A sparse white noise pattern was projected on the prosthesis using 880nm light to measure the electrical receptive fields (eRFs) of inDividual neurons. A visible white noise stimulus was used to measure the natural receptive fields (RFs) of the same neurons. Spatial resolution was also evaluated by reversing the contrast of linear gratings of various spatial frequencies at 2Hz. Result(s): With 140pm photoDiode pixels, the mean eRF Diameter in LE retinas was 535 +/- 153pm. With 70pm pixels, approximately 90% of the RGCs had localized eRFs with a mean Diameter of 248 +/- 59pm, comparable to the mean RF of the same neurons, 249 +/- 44pm. The remaining 10% of RGCs exhibited a center-surround response structure, with strong localized stimulation in the center of the eRF and lower amplitude, Diffuse stimulation over a surround that could spread over a circular area of 490-560pm Diameter . With 70pm pixels in RCS rats, the mean eRF Diameter was 205 +/- 69pm. For RCS rat retinas stimulated by 70pm pixels, inDividual RGCs responded to contrast reversal of the 140pm stripes and Did not respond to 35pm grating stripes. Conclusion(s): The average size of RGC eRFs obtained with a photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis, having 70pm bipolar pixels, is similar to the average size of natural RFs in the rat retina, and average eRF Diameter doubles when pixel size increases from 70 to 140um. The average size of eRFs in degenerate retina (RCS) is similar to that in the WT retina. 70 pm bipolar pixels can sometimes elicit center-surround responses, with center and surround having Different latencies. Initial results inDicate that the 70pm implant can resolve gratings with stripes smaller than 140pm, and larger than 35pm .

DO  - NA
AU  - Radford S.J.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Proper chromosome segregation is achieved through the regulated interaction of chromosomes with a bipolar array of microtubules that constitute the spindle. The meiotic spindle in the oocytes of many organisms, including humans and Drosophila, is built in the absence of the classical microtubuleorganizing centers known as centrosomes. In the presence of centrosomes, chromosome segregation depends on interactions between the kinetochore, a protein complex that assembles at the centromere, and microtubules that connect to the centrosomes. However, it has been suggested that kinetochoremicrotubule interactions may not participate in chromosome congression or segregation in acentrosomal oocytes. To determine the role of kinetochores during spindle assembly and chromosome orientation in Drosophila oocytes, we used a technique in which RNAi knockdown of kinetochore components is confined to oocytes after meiotic entry. Our results suggest that the proportion of kinetochore-dependent microtubules in the spindle changes as oocytes progress from prometaphase to metaphase, such that kinetochores are essential for metaphase spindle stability. In addition, we found that both lateral and end-on kinetochore-microtubule interactions are required for the proper orientation of centromeres toward spindle poles, although lateral interactions are sufficient for prometaphase chromosome movements. Surprisingly, we also found that the kinetochore may play a role in sister centromere co-orientation, perhaps by affecting sister chromatid cohesion. These results support a model in which oocyte chromosomes initially interact with microtubules laterally at kinetochores while orientation is established, then end-on kinetochore-microtubule interactions are required to direct chromosome segregation.

AB  - Neuropsychological tests of visual perception mostly assess high-level processes like object recognition.Object recognition however, relies on distinct mid-level processes of perceptual organization that are only implicitly tested in classical tests. To fill this gap, we developed the Leuven Perceptual Organization Screening Test (L-POST), in which a wide a range of mid-level phenomena are measured as independently as possible. The L-POST consists of 15 sub-tests screening for various aspects of perceptual organization, such as shape perception, figure-ground segmentation, and is sensitive to several grouping cues, such as common fate, collinearity, proximity and closure. To reduce cognitive load, a matching-to-sample task is used for all test items. Our free online test can be administered in 20-30 minutes, and a neglect-friendly version is available. The test has been validated with 40 brain-lesioned patients in which performance on the LPOST was compared to standard clinical tests of visual perception and other measures of cognitive function to evaluate convergent and divergent validity, respectively. The L-POST showed high sensitivity to visual dysfunction and decreased performance was specific to visual problems. In addition, we collected a norming sample of more than 1200 healthy control participants. In this sample, we observed a decline of L-POST scores with increasing age. No differencewas observed between participants who filled in the test with and without supervision of a research assistant.We are now exploring the use of the L-POST in other neurological and psychiatric disorders that have been associated with altered visual perception (e.g. schizophrenia, dementia, autism). In conclusion, the L-POST is a valuable screening test for perceptual organization. It offers a useful tool for researchers and clinicians to get a broader overview of the mid-level processes that are preserved or disrupted in a given patient.

AB  - While looking for evidence of quantum coherent states within the brain, many quantum mind advocates proposed experiments based on the assumption that the coherent state of a photon entering the visual system could somehow be preserved through the neural processing, or in other words they suppose that photons collapse not in the retina, but in the brain cortex. In this paper we show that photons do collapse within the retina and subsequent processing of information at the level of neural membranes proceeds. Moreover, we explicitly stress on the fact that due to existent amplification of the signal produced by each photon, a basic quantum mechanical theorem forbids the photon state to be teleported from the retina to the brain cortex. The changes of the membrane potential of the neurons in the primary visual cortex are shown to be relevant to inputting visual sensory information that is already processed and is not identical to the visual image entering in the retina. A striking evidence for the existent processing of the incoming visual information by the retina is provided by visual illusions resulting from the lateral inhibition mechanism.

AB  - Purpose of Study: Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit unusual sensory experiences, ranging from visual or auditory distortions to dynamic hallucinations. Oscillatory neuronal electrical activity in the range of 30Y50 Hz (the gamma-band oscillation) has been proposed to involve feature binding or inter-regional communication within the brain and is critically dependent on inhibitory neurotransmission within the cerebral cortex. Gamma-band oscillatory power has been reported to be impaired in persons with schizophrenia and is also found in the first-degree relatives of persons with schizophrenia, suggesting a heritable component. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) technologies have repeatedly shown this effect, making the measure an exciting potential tool that could be useful to other researchers. However, no one has yet performed test-retest measurements in the same group of subjects. This study is a necessity before such data can be used in large-scale projects such as genetic linkage analyses or as biomarkers in clinical trials. Methods Used: Twenty healthy and normal hearing adults screened for personal and family history of mental illness and neurological disorders will be recruited. The subjects will be recorded in an auditory steady state response (ASSR) paradigm while having a 64-channel EEG recording followed by a 248-channel MEG recording. One week later, they will return and repeat the same procedures. We will be comparing two stimuli in the MEG and EEG runs - amplitude modulated white noise and click trains, binaurally presented at 75 dB SPL. Both produce strong 40 Hz responses.We will be looking at phase-locked response amplitude and phase-locking factors, in both sensor and source space. The reliability of the source localization will also be a secondary interest variable. Analysis of ASSR-derived measures of gamma-band power and inter-trial phase-locking for retest reliability will ensue. Summary of Results: With five of twenty subjects completed, no results have yet been analyzed. Conclusion(s): We expect to see a high level of test-retest reliability with the MEG and expect it to be significantly greater than that seen in the EEG recording.

AB  - Deficits in early perceptual organization were reported in subjects with schizophrenia by several electrophysiological investigations. The present study was aimed to investigate, in stabilized patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, the time course of visual percept integration by means of an EEG-based, high-temporal resolution neuroimaging technique.Twenty patients and twenty age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 30 unipolar leads while perceiving randomly presented apparent motion and motion standstill illusions, or isoluminant static control stimuli. The three-dimensional distribution of cortical current density of the average microstate for each ERP component was analyzed using LORETA.P100 field strength and activity of cortical generators were reduced in patients vs healthy controls for all stimuli. Only in the patient group the activity of P100 and N100 cortical generators did not discriminate illusory and static stimuli. Unlike controls, patients did not present the inclusion of the P200 into the late positive complex for motion standstill, and presented the N4 component for static stimuli with low complexity.The pattern of results indicates an impairment of early cortical integration in patients with schizophrenia, involving the first two ERP components, but extending to later phases for stimuli with low complexity.

AB  - Objective: Although previous studies have shown that the theory of mind (ToM) ability is impaired in Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and in schizophrenia, few controlled studies compared the ToM performance between the two disorders. Besides, the relationship between the degree of ToM impairment and symptom dimensions is unclear, and presence of ToM impairment in remitted patients with schizophrenia is controversial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms were closer to AS patients and different than schizophrenia patients without prominent negative symptoms and healthy controls in terms of ToM functioning. Method: Fourteen patients with AS, 20 with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls, matched by age, educational level and IQ scores were enrolled. AS was diagnosed according to the DSMIV criteria and independently confirmed by two psychiatrists. Schizophrenia patients were diagnosed by the Turkish version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnosis (SCID-I) and symptom severity was evaluated with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative and Positive Symptoms. Schizophrenia group consisted of clinically stable patients. The ToM battery included stories to assess first and second order false belief tasks (ToM1 and ToM2). The full-scale IQ, Verbal Comprehension, Freedom from Distractibility and Perceptual Organization scores were assessed by Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). Non-parametric tests were used to compare the neuropsychological performances of the three groups. In order to investigate whether schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms were similar to AS patients, schizophrenia patients were divided into high (Sch-HN) and low (Sch-LN) negative-symptom subgroups by median split. For these four groups (AS, Sch-HN, Sch-LN, and controls) between group comparisons were performed. Correlations between the clinical measures and ToM performance were assessed by Spearman correlation test. Results: AS and schizophrenia patients performed significantly worse than controls in the ToM2 task, while the AS group had worse ToM1 performance than both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The Sch-HN subgroup had significantly lower ToM2 scores than the Sch-LN patients, and worse ToM1 functioning than the controls. Conclusions: These results suggest that clinically stable schizophrenia patients have ToM impairments. Sch-HN group performed comparably poorly as the AS group, while the Sch-LN group was relatively spared. The most profoundly impaired patients with schizophrenia in terms of ToM functioning were represented by those with high negative symptoms (Sch-HN). Similar to AS, as a neurodevelopmental impairment, these patients may not have developed ToM ability, or they may have lost their ToM capacity as a result of a neurodegenerative process during the illness. Supplementary studies using other methods (e.g., neuroimaging, neurophysiology) may highlight the brain regions that are affected differentially in AS and schizophrenia, the relationship of ToM impairments and negative symptoms, and the role of ToM impairments in the neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative hypothesis of schizophrenia.

AB  - Room tilt illusion, a misperception that the entire room is tilted, is a rare but nonspecific neurological symptom. We report a patient with Parkinson's disease who developed typical room tilt illusion. Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated hypoperfusion of the posterior area of the right intraparietal sulcus, which is related to discriminating the surface orientation of three-dimensional objects. Therefore, it is possible that dysfunction of this region of the intraparietal sulcus may have disrupted the integration of spatial reference frames for internal representation of the surrounding space in our patient, and thus may have caused room tilt illusion. <c2><a9> 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Obesity in severely mentally ill (SMI) populations is an increasing problem, but there is no controlled data regarding the relationship between SMI and weight perception. Method(s): Fifty patients with schizophrenia and 50 demographically matched control participants were recruited. Weight, height, and body image accuracy were assessed for all participants, and assessments of mood, psychotic symptom severity and anxiety, and preferred modes of weight loss were assessed for the schizophrenia sample. Result(s): Patients with schizophrenia were significantly more likely to be obese than controls (46% vs. 18%, P < 0.005), and most patients expressed an interest in losing weight. Obese participants with schizophrenia underestimated their body size (11.0%) more than controls (4.9%) (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Patients with schizophrenia are more likely to underestimate their body size, independent of the effects of obesity. However, they also express concern about weight issues and willingness to participate in psychoeducational groups targeted at weight loss.

AB  - Recent findings suggest that specific deficits in neural synchrony and binding may underlie cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia and that key aspects of schizophrenia pathology involve discoordination and disconnection of distributed processes in multiple cortical areas associated with cognitive deficits. In the present study we aimed to investigate the underlying cortical mechanism of disturbed frontal-temporal-central-parietal connectivity in schizophrenia by examination of the synchronization patterns using wavelet phase synchronization index and coherence between all defined couples of 8 EEG signals recorded at different cortical sites in its relationship to positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 31 adult schizophrenic outpatients with diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia (mean age 27.4) were assessed in the study. The obtained results present the first quantitative evidence indicating direct relationship between wavelet phase synchronization and coherence in pairs of EEG signals recorded from frontal, temporal, central and parietal brain areas and positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The performed analysis demonstrates that the level of phase synchronization and coherence in some pairs of EEG signals is inversely related to positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology in temporal scales (frequency ranges) given by wavelet frequencies (WFs) equal to or higher than 7.56 Hz, and positively related to negative symptoms in wavelet frequencies equal to or lower than 5.35 Hz. This finding suggests that higher and lower frequencies may play a specific role in binding and connectivity and may be related to decreased or increased synchrony with specific manifestation in cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. <c2><a9> 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This commentary highlights methods for using scalp EEG to make inferences about contextual field interactions, which, in view of the target article, may be specially relevant to the study of schizophrenia. Although scalp EEG has limited spatial resolution, prior knowledge combined with experimental manipulations may be used to strengthen inferences about underlying brain processes. Both spatial and temporal context are discussed within the framework of nonlinear interactions. Finally, results from a visual contour integration EEG pilot study are summarized in view of a hypothesis that relates receptive field and contextual field processing to evoked and induced activity, respectively.

AB  - The concept of locally specialized functions dominates research on higher brain function and its disorders. Locally specialized functions must be complemented by processes that coordinate those functions, however, and impairment of coordinating processes may be central to some psychotic conditions. Evidence for processes that coordinate activity is provided by neurobiological and psychological studies of contextual disambiguation and dynamic grouping. Mechanisms by which this important class of cognitive functions could be achieved include those long-range connections within and between cortical regions that activate synaptic channels via NMDA-receptors, and which control gain through their voltage-dependent mode of operation. An impairment of these mechanisms is central to PCP-psychosis, and the cognitive capabilities that they could provide are impaired in some forms of schizophrenia. We conclude that impaired cognitive coordination due to reduced ion flow through NMDA-channels is involved in schizophrenia, and we suggest that it may also be involved in other disorders. This perspective suggests several ways in which further research could enhance our understanding of cognitive coordination, its neural basis, and its relevance to psychopathology.

AB  - The syndrome of Alice in Wonderland denotes a variety of self-experienced paroxysmal body schema disturbances which may co-occur with depersonalization, derealization, visual illusions and disorders of time perception. A case report of a female migraine sufferer who both described and illustrated her Alice in Wonderland experiences is presented. The phenomenological similarities between the Alice in Wonderland syndrome occurring as migraine aura and the cenesthesias and cognitive perceptual disturbances encountered in idiopathic schizophrenic psychoses support the notion of an organic etiology of the last mentioned symptoms, as postulated in Huber's concept of basic symptoms of functional psychoses.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia have been described as being poor at processing Gestalt aspects of stimuli, but efficient in processing their local aspects. The present study examined Gestalt processing in normal subjects classified according to the positive dimensions of schizotypy. It further explored whether the Gestalt deficit is due to a more fundamental deficit in rapid global processing which occurs at an early stage and precedes local processing. In addition, it was postulated that the right hemisphere should be more involved in dysfunctional global processing. Thirty-three normal individuals assessed as having high or low scores on schizotypy scales were asked to recall the name of a set of hierarchically formed letters in a divided visual field paradigm. The results support a deficit in involuntary rapid global processing and an underlying right- hemisphere dysfunction in high scorers on the unusual experiences' (UnEx) and STA scales of schizotypy. This indicates that in such subjects local stimuli excessively intrude into the processing of global information in the right hemisphere. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A 28-year-old man survived midbrain trauma. A diurnally varying dystonia-parkinsonism-delirium-panic syndrome emerged after 1 year. Auditory hallucinations were also associated with dystonia and may relate to tegmental pathology. This patient also manifested panic attacks independent of dystonia, visual illusions resembling post-hallucinogen perceptions, paranoia, bipolar mood disturbance, compulsions, generalized anxiety (GA), dystonia and parkinsonism independent of delirium and panic, and myoclonus. Neuropsychological findings are also presented. The conditions are discussed in relation to midbrain structures and clinical management. These disorders may relate to pathology of midbrain structures and tracts pertaining to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, cerebellum, reticular formation, and peripheral sensation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) improved bipolar disorder, paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA but low-dose CBZ actually exacerbated GA. Trihexyphenidyl (THP) improved dystonia and parkinsonism but worsened paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA. THP improved dystonic frequency before reducing dystonic severity. Paroxetine improved illusions and dystonia but seemed to precipitate panic attacks. Illusions resembled palinopsia and post-hallucinogen perceptual disorder and may relate to reduced stimulation of 5HT2 serotonin receptors. Careful clinical vigilance and planning are indicated when treating patients with midbrain pathology.

AB  - Previous examinations of working memory impairments in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have predominantly focused on discreet visuospatial and phonological subsystem processes, as well as the domain-general central executive. The episodic buffer component of working memory, a neurocognitive process that allows for temporary storage and maintenance of bound episodes/features of information, is understudied in ADHD and initial findings have been equivocal. Heterogeneity in previous findings may reflect between-study methodological variability, floor effects unrelated to episodic buffer processes (i.e., excessive central executive demands), and limitations associated with previous investigations' use of novel paradigms. This study examined ADHD-related episodic buffer processing via an established paradigm (Allen et al., 2006) in well-defined groups of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing peers (TD). Seventy-one children (ADHD n = 34, TD n = 37) aged 8-12 years (M = 9.81, SD = 1.50; 32% female) completed two conditions of a computerized working memory task that presented single feature stimuli (color and shape), and a third condition that presented dual-feature stimuli (color/shape binding). Overall, the ADHD group exhibited a large-magnitude deficit during the color/shape binding condition (d = .77), and both groups evinced worse performance accuracy in the color/shape binding condition compared to the single feature color and shape conditions. Collectively, these findings appear to provide evidence that children with ADHD exhibit large magnitude episodic buffer deficits that are not attributable to visuospatial subsystem or domain-general central executive processes.

AB  - Closed-eye visual hallucinations are rare and poorly understood isolated visualizations that emerge after eye closure. Here, we report a case of highly complex closed-eye visual hallucinations associated with clarithromycin.However, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of closed-eye visual hallucinations emerging in the context of clarithromycin use. Through suppression of endogenous GABA-ergic signaling, we hypothesized that clarithromycin may predispose to visual-release phenomena in susceptible individuals. A woman in her eighties was in her usual state of health until 2 days after being started on clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Reductions in GABA-ergic signaling and relative imbalances with excitatory glutaminergic signaling have been linked to a range of other perceptual disturbances, including deficits in orientation specific surround suppression in the context of schizophrenia and deficits in visual contrast perception.

AB  - Cone photoreceptors are the first neurons along the visual pathway that exhibit center-surround antagonistic receptive fields, the basic building blocks for spatial information processing in the visual system. The surround responses in cones are mediated by the horizontal cells (HCs) via multiple feedback synaptic mechanisms. It has been controversial on which mechanisms are responsible for the surround-elicited depolarizing responses in cones (DELTAVCone(s)), and whether the surround responses of various types of cones are mediated by the same HC feedback mechanisms. In this report, we studied DELTAVCone(s)) of four types of cones in the salamander retina, and found that they are mediated by feedback synapses from A-type, B-type or A- and B-type HCs. DELTAVCone(s) are observable in the presence of concomitant center light spots, and surround + center light stimuli of various intensity, size and wavelength differentially activate the feedback synapses from A- and B-type HCs to cones. We found that DELTAVCone(s) of the L-cones are mediated by both A- and B-type HCs, those of the P- and S-cones by B-type HCs, and those of the A-cones by the A-type HCs. Moreover, our results suggest that B-type HCs mediate DELTAVCone(s) through both GABAergic and GluT-ClC feedback synaptic mechanisms, and A-type HCs mediate DELTAVCone(s) via the GluT-ClC feedback mechanism. Feedback synaptic mechanisms that increase calcium influx in cone synaptic terminals play important roles in mediating the antagonistic surround responses in the postsynaptic bipolar cells, but they may not generate enough current to depolarize the cones and significantly contribute to DELTAVCone(s).

AB  - This study investigates the existence of cross-modal correspondences between a series of paintings by Kandinsky and a series of selections from Schonberg music. The experiment was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, by means of the Osgood semantic differential, the participants evaluated the perceptual characteristics first of visual stimuli (some pictures of Kandinsky's paintings, with varying perceptual characteristics and contents) and then of auditory stimuli (musical excerpts taken from the repertoire of Schonberg's piano works) relative to 11 pairs of adjectives tested on a continuous bipolar scale. In the second phase, participants were required to associate pictures and musical excerpts. The results of the semantic differential test show that certain paintings and musical excerpts were evaluated as semantically more similar, while others were evaluated as semantically more different. The results of the direct association between musical excerpts and paintings showed both attractions and repulsions among the stimuli. The overall results provide significant insights into the relationship between concrete and abstract concepts and into the process of perceptual grouping in cross-modal phenomena.

AB  - During adaptation to an increase in environmental luminance, retinal signaling adjustments are mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine. Retinal dopamine is released with light and can affect center-surround receptive fields, the coupling state between neurons, and inhibitory pathways through inhibitory receptors and neurotransmitter release. While the inhibitory receptive field surround of bipolar cells becomes narrower and weaker during light adaptation, it is unknown how dopamine affects bipolar cell surrounds. If dopamine and light have similar effects, it would suggest that dopamine could be a mechanism for light-adapted changes. We tested the hypothesis that dopamine D1 receptor activation is sufficient to elicit the magnitude of light-adapted reductions in inhibitory bipolar cell surrounds. Surrounds were measured from OFF bipolar cells in dark-adapted mouse retinas while stimulating D1 receptors, which are located on bipolar, horizontal, and inhibitory amacrine cells. The D1 agonist SKF-38393 narrowed and weakened OFF bipolar cell inhibitory receptive fields but not to the same extent as with light adaptation. However, the receptive field surround reductions differed between the glycinergic and GABAergic components of the receptive field. GABAergic inhibitory strength was reduced only at the edges of the surround, while glycinergic inhibitory strength was reduced across the whole receptive field. These results expand the role of retinal dopamine to include modulation of bipolar cell receptive field surrounds. Additionally, our results suggest that D1 receptor pathways may be a mechanism for the light-adapted weakening of glycinergic surround inputs and the furthest wide-field GABAergic inputs to bipolar cells. However, remaining differences between light-adapted and D1 receptor-activated inhibition demonstrate that non-D1 receptor mechanisms are necessary to elicit the full effect of light adaptation on inhibitory surrounds.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 10[1898] of Frontiers in Psychology (see record 2019-53963-001). In the original article, we neglected to include the funder ''European Research Council (ERC), ERC Consolidator Award'' to Professor Sukhwinder S. Shergill. A correction has therefore been made to Acknowledgments and the correct statement appears below: ''This work was funded by the Wellcome Trust. SS received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Award. The authors gratefully acknowledge the generous assistance of Cambian Healthcare in the data collection. The authors have no financial interests to disclose.'' The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way. The original article has been updated.] Compared to unaffected observers patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show characteristic differences in visual perception, including a reduced susceptibility to the influence of context on judgments of contrast-a manifestation of weaker surround suppression (SS). To examine the generality of this phenomenon we measured the ability of 24 individuals with SZ to judge the luminance, contrast, orientation, and size of targets embedded in contextual surrounds that would typically influence the target's appearance. Individuals with SZ demonstrated weaker SS compared to matched controls for stimuli defined by contrast or size, but not for those defined by luminance or orientation. As perceived luminance is thought to be regulated at the earliest stages of visual processing our findings are consistent with a suppression deficit that is predominantly cortical in origin. In addition, we propose that preserved orientation SS in SZ may reflect the sparing of broadly tuned mechanisms of suppression. We attempt to reconcile these data with findings from previous studies.

AB  - Our ability to integrate multiple sensory-based representations of our surrounding supplies us with a more holistic view of our world. There are many complex algorithms our nervous system uses to construct a coherent perception. An indicator to solve this 'binding problem' are the temporal characteristics with the specificity that environmental information has different propagation speeds (e.g., sound and electromagnetic waves) and sensory processing time and thus the temporal relationship of a stimulus pair derived from the same event must be flexibly adjusted by our brain. This tolerance can be conceptualized in the form of the cross-modal temporal binding window (TBW). Several studies showed the plasticity of the TBW and its importance concerning audio-visual illusions, synesthesia, as well as psychiatric disturbances. Using three audio-visual paradigms, we investigated the importance of length (short vs. long) as well as modality (uni- vs. multimodal) of a perceptual training aiming at reducing the TBW in a healthy population. We also investigated the influence of the TBW on speech intelligibility, where participants had to integrate auditory and visual speech information from a videotaped speaker. We showed that simple sensory trainings can change the TBW and are capable of optimizing speech perception at a very naturalistic level. While the training-length had no different effect on the malleability of the TBW, the multisensory trainings induced a significantly stronger narrowing of the TBW than their unisensory counterparts. Furthermore, a narrowing of the TBW was associated with a better performance in speech perception, meaning that participants showed a greater capacity for integrating informations from different sensory modalities in situations with one modality impaired. All effects persisted at least seven days. Our findings show the significance of multisensory temporal processing regarding ecologically valid measures and have important clinical implications for interventions that may be used to alleviate debilitating conditions (e.g., autism, schizophrenia), in which multisensory temporal function is shown to be impaired.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after the procedures had been fully explained. This study was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the research ethics committee at each institution. Details of the methods are described in the Supplementary materials and methods. Table S1 shows detailed demographic data of the 69 subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and 246 healthy subjects (HS) included in the initial study. The eye movement score, all three individual eye movement measures comprising the eye movement score, and work hours differed significantly between SZ and HS (Table S2). Our results revealed an association between eye movement and work hours with a potential mediation of cognitive ability related to the perceptual organization in schizophrenia.

AB  - Reports an error in "Visual population receptive fields in people with schizophrenia have reduced inhibitory surrounds" by Elaine J. Anderson, Marc S. Tibber, D. Sam Schwarzkopf, Sukhwinder S. Shergill, Emilio Fernandez-Egea, Geraint Rees and Steven C. Dakin (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2017[Feb][8], Vol 37[6], 1546-1556). In the original article, there is an error in Figure 2, where the labels at the bottom of the two columns have been incorrectly switched. The correct labels are shown in the figure presented in the erratum and corrected on the online PDF version. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-23376-018). People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal visual perception on a range of visual tasks, which have been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. However, differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons, which might explain these visual anomalies, have yet to be reported in vivo. Here, we probed the neural basis of these deficits using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a difference-of-Gaussian model to capture the center-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2, and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our view is that insomnia may be a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences such as paranoia and hallucinations. However, the causal relationship is not established. The aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of insomnia in psychotic experiences via a sleep restriction manipulation. The study was a within-subjects crossover design that included a planned mediation analysis. Sixty-eight nonclinical volunteers underwent a sleep loss condition (restricted to 4 h sleep for 3 nights) and a control condition (standard sleep) in randomized order in 2 consecutive weeks, with a weekend washout period. Psychotic experiences (paranoia, hallucinations, grandiosity, and cognitive disorganization) and candidate mediating variables (negative affect and related processes, working memory, decision making, and perceptual processing) were assessed before and after each condition. Actigraphy verified an average sleep duration of 5 h 15 min in the sleep loss condition, vs 6 h 58 min in the control condition. After the sleep loss condition, relative to the control condition, participants reported significant increases in paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization, with no significant changes in grandiosity. The sleep loss condition was also associated with significant increases in negative affect, negative self and other cognitions, worry, and working memory impairment. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by changes in negative affect and related processes, but not memory impairment. The overall conclusion is that insomnia has a causal role in the occurrence of certain psychotic experiences, and that a key route is via negative affect.

AB  - In the mammalian retina, horizontal cells receive glutamatergic inputs from many rod and cone photoreceptors and return feedback signals to them, thereby changing photoreceptor glutamate release in a light-dependent manner. Horizontal cells also provide feedforward signals to bipolar cells. It is unclear, however, how horizontal cell signals also affect the temporal, spatial, and contrast tuning in retinal output neurons, the ganglion cells. To study this, we generated a genetically modified mouse line in which we eliminated the light dependency of feedback by deleting glutamate receptors from mouse horizontal cells. This genetic modification allowed us to investigate the impact of horizontal cells on ganglion cell signaling independent of the actual mode of feedback in the outer retina and without pharmacological manipulation of signal transmission. In control and genetically modified mice (both sexes), we recorded the light responses of transient OFF-alpha retinal ganglion cells in the intact retina. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were reduced and the cells were tuned to lower temporal frequencies and higher contrasts, presumably because photoreceptor output was attenuated. Moreover, receptive fields of recorded cells showed a significantly altered surround structure. Our data thus suggest that horizontal cells are responsible for adjusting the dynamic range of retinal ganglion cells and, together with amacrine cells, contribute to the center/surround organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the mouse.

AB  - The retina adjusts its signaling gain over a wide range of light levels. A functional result of this is increased visual acuity at brighter luminance levels (light adaptation) due to shifts in the excitatory center-inhibitory surround receptive field parameters of ganglion cells that increases their sensitivity to smaller light stimuli. Recent work supports the idea that changes in ganglion cell spatial sensitivity with background luminance are due in part to inner retinal mechanisms, possibly including modulation of inhibition onto bipolar cells. To determine how the receptive fields of OFF cone bipolar cells may contribute to changes in ganglion cell resolution, the spatial extent and magnitude of inhibitory and excitatory inputs were measured from OFF bipolar cells under dark- and light-adapted conditions. There was no change in the OFF bipolar cell excitatory input with light adaptation; however, the spatial distributions of inhibitory inputs, including both glycinergic and GABAergic sources, became significantly narrower, smaller, and more transient. The magnitude and size of the OFF bipolar cell center-surround receptive fields as well as light-adapted changes in resting membrane potential were incorporated into a spatial model of OFF bipolar cell output to the downstream ganglion cells, which predicted an increase in signal output strength with light adaptation. We show a prominent role for inner retinal spatial signals in modulating the modeled strength of bipolar cell output to potentially play a role in ganglion cell visual sensitivity and acuity.

AB  - Despite a conceptual link between the Rorschach Coping Deficit Index (CDI) and a loss of cognitive and functional capacity, no published study has explored whether or how the CDI relates to these characteristics as measured by other neuropsychological test instruments. We examined the relationship between the CDI and neurocognitive abilities of language skills, perceptual organization, memory, and executive functioning separately in adolescent psychiatric inpatients (n = 267), as well as in adults with first episode schizophrenia or severe affective disorder (n = 117), and healthy adults (n = 94). We found a significant link between the CDI and limited cognitive capacity. Impaired comprehension predicted the elevated CDI in adolescents whereas perseveration tendency and impaired delayed memory in adult patients and impaired memory functions in healthy people predicted the elevated CDI. The CDI seems to include neurocognitive aspects, and may reflect persistent deterioration associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The Rorschach Coping Deficit Index (CDI) has been linked to social competence. Most of the variables included in this index seem to relate to interpersonal needs or deficits. In clinical practice we have found that many patients with a CDI >= 4 also perform poorly in certain neurocognitive domains. One gap in the clinical validity literature is that it is unknown how the performance on the CDI relates to measures of cognitive ability. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the CDI and neurocognitive abilities of language skills, perceptual organization, memory, and executive functioning separately in three cross-sectional samples comprising adolescent inpatients (n = 267), adult inpatients (n = 117), and healthy adults (n = 94). We found a significant relationship between coping deficits as assessed by the CDI and poor performance on neurocognitive tests. Poor comprehension accounted best for coping deficits in adolescent patients. Perseverative responses and delayed memory accounted best for coping deficits in adult patients, signifying substantial limitations in cognitive flexibility and adaptive capacities. In healthy persons, impaired verbal memory predicted coping deficits. In conclusion, the CDI as a general measure of capacities for coping with the demands of daily life includes an important neurocognitive aspect. When we examined the single variables included in the CDI, we found that four of the five criteria consist of variables such as EA, COP, WSumC, active and passive movement responses and H, which were significantly related to cognitive performance. The CDI may easily increase with variables that are related to cognitive functions. The notion of targeting treatment to social skills training has been thought to improve deficits in coping capacity. Cognitive impairment could, however, interfere with the ability to benefit from interventions based on learning, such as social skills training. Further research is needed to examine in more detail the validity of the CDI as a measure of neuropsychological dysfunction.

La plupart des variables inclues dans cet indice semblent liees aux besoins ou deficits interpersonnels. En pratique clinique, nous avons constate que de nombreux patients ayant un CDI >= 4 sont peu performants dans certains domaines neurocognitifs. Une des lacunes dans la litterature clinique pertinente est que la maniere dont les performances en rapport avec le CDI sont en relation avec des mesures d'aptitudes cognitives reste inconnue. Dans cette etude, nous avons examine le lien entre le CDI et les capacites neurocognitives languagieres, d'organisation perceptuelle, de memoire et de fonctionnement executif separement dans des echantillons transversaux comprenant des patients adolescents (n = 267), des patients adultes (117) et des personnes adultes en bonne sante (94). Nous avons constate une relation significative entre l'incompetence sociale evaluee par le CDI et une faible performance aux tests neurocognitifs. Les deficits de comprehension ont le mieux rendu compte de cette relation parmi les patients adolescents. Les reponses perseveratives et les deficits de memoire differee ont le mieux rendu compte de cette relation parmi les patients adultes, suggerant des deficits importants dans les domaines de flexibilite cognitive et des capacites d'adaptation. Parmi les personnes en bonne sante, les deficits de memoire verbale ont le mieux rendu compte de cette relation. En conclusion, le CDI, en tant que mesure generale des capacites de repondre aux exigences de la vie quotidienne, comprend un aspect neurocognitif important. Lorsque nous avons examine les variables individuelles comprises dans le CDI, nous avons constate que quatre criteres sur cinq, a savoir des variables comme EA, COP, WSumC, les reponses de mouvement actif ou passif et H, etaient en relation etroite avec les performances cognitives. Le CDI peut facilement s' elever en rapport avec des variables liees aux fonctions cognitives. La notion d'un traitement centre sur l'apprentissage d'aptitudes sociales a ete proposee pour remedier a l'incompetence sociale representee par le CDI. Dans certains cas, les deficits cognitifs pourraient toutefois faire obstacle a la capacite du sujet a beneficier d'interventions reposant sur l'apprentissage, telles que l'apprentissage d'aptitudes sociales. Des etudes plus approfondies sont necessaires pour mettre en evidence de maniere plus detaillee la validite du CDI en tant que mesure de dysfonctionnement neuropsychologique.

La mayor parte de las variables que se incluyen en el indice parecen relacionarse con las necesidades o deficits interpersonales. En la practica clinica hemos observado que muchos pacientes con un CDI >= 4 tambien tienen un desempeno pobre en algunos dominios neurocognitivos. Un hecho que supone una laguna en la literatura sobre validez clinica es que no se sabe como se relaciona el desempeno en el CDI con los indicadores de la capacidad cognitiva basica. En el presente estudio, hemos investigado la relacion que existe entre el CDI y las capacidades neurocognitivas de la habilidad para el lenguaje, la organizacion perceptual, la memoria y el funcionamiento ejecutivo, por separado en tres muestras transversales que constan de pacientes hospitalizados adolescentes (n = 267), pacientes hospitalizados adultos (117) y personas adultas sanas (94). Hallamos una relacion significativa entre la inhabilidad social segun la evalua el CDI y un desempeno pobre en las pruebas neurocognitivas. En pacientes adolescentes, la falta de capacidad de afrontamiento o inhabilidad social se vio expresada en la mala comprension. En pacientes adultos, las respuestas perseverantes y la memoria retardada encontraron justificacion en la inhabilidad social, lo cual implica importantes limitaciones en la flexibilidad cognitiva y las capacidades de adaptacion. En personas sanas, los problemas en la memoria verbal anticiparon la inhabilidadsocial. En conclusion, el CDI como una medicion general de las habilidades para afrontar las exigencias de la vida diaria incluye un aspecto neurocognitivo importante. Al analizar la variables del CDI individualmente, hallamos que cuatro de los cinco criterios estaban compuestos de variables que se encontraban altamente relacionadas con el desempeno cognitivo, como EA, COP, WSumC, respuestas de movimiento activas y pasivas, y H. El CDI podria aumentar facilmente con variables relacionadas con la cognicion. Se ha creido que apuntar el tratamiento a las habilidades sociales mejora el deficit en la capacidad de afrontamiento. Sin embargo, la disfuncion cognitiva podria interferir con la capacidad para beneficiarse de las intervenciones basadas en el aprendizaje, como el entrenamiento de las habilidades sociales. Es necesario continuar investigando para poder examinar con mas detalle la validez del CDI como un indicador de disfuncion neuropsicologica.

AB  - Current research on perceptual organization in schizophrenia frequently employs shapes with regularly sampled contours (fragmented stimuli), in noise fields composed of similar elements, to elicit visual abnormalities. However, perceptual organization is multi-factorial and, in earlier studies, continuous contours have also been employed in tasks assessing the ability to extract shapes from a background. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using closed-contour stimuli, including the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) and related tasks, both in people with schizophrenia and in healthy schizotypes and relatives, considered at increased risk for psychosis. Eleven studies met the selection criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, including six that used a between-groups study design (i.e., perceptual organization abilities of schizophrenia/high-risk groups were compared to healthy or clinical controls), and five that treated schizophrenia symptoms or schizotypy traits and indices of perceptual organization as continuous variables. Effect sizes and heterogeneity statistics were calculated, and the risk of publication bias was explored. A significant, moderate effect for EFT performance was found with studies that compared performance of schizophrenia/high-risk groups to a healthy or patient comparison group (d = -0.523, p < 0.001). However, significant heterogeneity was also found amongst the schizotypy, but not schizophrenia studies, as well as studies using accuracy, but not reaction time as a measure of performance. A non-significant correlation was found for the studies that examined schizophrenia symptoms or schizotypy traits as continuous variables (r = 0.012, p = 0.825). These results suggest that deficits in perceptual organization of non-fragmented stimuli are found when differences between schizophrenia/high-risk groups and comparison groups are maximized. These findings should motivate further investigation of perceptual organization abilities with closed-contour stimuli both in schizophrenia and high-risk groups, which is pertinent to current initiatives to improve the assessment and treatment of cognition in schizophrenia.

The corrected name is Maria Giovanna Caprioli.] Presents a case report of a 46-year-old woman with a 14-year history of paranoid schizophrenia presented as outpatient. She had received both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for more than 10 years. These drugs were not well tolerated because of extrapyramidal side effects. Recently, she had been prescribed paliperidone, 6 mg/d, with significant remission of her symptoms. Since this new therapy was introduced, the patient experienced frequent attacks of visual illusions. These attacks were characterized by small dark spots overlapping with the objects present in the visual field, sometimes associated with hyperchromatopsia, rosopometamorphopsia, and distortion of contours, accompanied by intense photophobia and severe anxiety. These recurrent attacks were not associated nor followed by alteration of consciousness or headache. Approximately one-half of the episodes were associated with oculogyric crises, with uncontrolled eye blinking, followed by upward eye deviation. Neurologic examination, laboratory tests, computerized visual field testing, ictal and interictal electroencephalography, and brain MRI were normal. Therefore, a diagnosis of paroxysmal perceptual alteration (PPA) was made. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract Receptive fields (RFs) of most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) consist of an excitatory center and suppressive surround. The RF center arises from the summation of excitatory bipolar cell glutamatergic inputs, whereas the surround arises from lateral inhibitory inputs. In the retina, both gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and glycine are inhibitory neurotransmitters. A clear role for GABAergic inhibition modulating the RGC RF surround has been demonstrated across species. Glycinergic inhibition is more commonly associated with RF center modulation, although there is some evidence that it may contribute to the RF surround. The synaptic glycinergic chloride channels are formed by three homomeric beta and two homomeric alpha subunits that can be glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha4. GlyRalpha composition is responsible for currents with distinct decay kinetics. Their expression within the inner plexiform laminae and neuronal subtypes also differ. We studied the role of GlyR subunit selective modulation of RGC RF surrounds, using mice lacking GlyRalpha2 (Glra2-/-), GlyRalpha3 (Glra3-/-), or both (Glra2/3-/-). We chose this molecular genetic approach instead of pharmacological manipulation because there are no subunit selective antagonists and strychnine blocks all GlyRs. Comparisons of annulus-evoked responses among wild type (WT) and GlyRalpha knockouts (Glra2-/-, Glra3-/- and Glra2/3-/-) show that GlyRalpha2 inhibition enhances RF surround suppression and post-stimulus excitation in only WT OFF RGCs. Similarities in the responses in Glra2-/- and Glra2/3-/- RGCs verify these conclusions. Based on previous and current data, we propose that GlyRalpha2-mediated input uses a crossover inhibitory circuit. Further, we suggest that GlyRalpha2 modulates the OFF RGC RF center and surround independently. In summary, our results define a selective GlyR subunit-specific control of RF surround suppression in OFF RGCs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual processing in the retina depends on coordinated signaling by interneurons. Photoreceptor signals are relayed to ~20 ganglion cell types through a dozen excitatory bipolar interneurons, each responsive to light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF). ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways become tuned through specific connections with inhibitory interneurons: horizontal and amacrine cells. A major obstacle for understanding retinal circuitry is the unknown function of most of the ~30-40 amacrine cell types, each of which synapses onto a subset of bipolar cell terminals, ganglion cell dendrites, and other amacrine cells. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line in which vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) GABAergic interneurons express Cre recombinase. Targeted whole-cell recordings of fluorescently labeled VIP+ cells revealed three predominant types: wide-field bistratified and narrow-field monostratified cells with somas in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and medium-field monostratified cells with somas in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Bistratified INL cells integrated excitation and inhibition driven by bothONand OFF pathways with little spatial tuning. Narrow-field INL cells integrated excitation driven by the ON pathway and inhibition driven by both pathways, with pronounced hyperpolarizations at light offset. Monostratified GCL cells integrated excitation and inhibition driven by the ON pathway and showed center-surround spatial tuning. Optogenetic experiments showed that, collectively, VIP+cells made strong connections with OFFdelta, ON-OFF direction-selective, and W3 ganglion cells but weak, inconsistent connections with ON and OFFdelta cells. Revealing VIP+ cell morphologies, receptive fields and synaptic connections advances our understanding of their role in visual processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Numerous psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with differences in visual perception, and it has been proposed that the treatment of these differences may represent a novel means to treat disorders like schizophrenia. Unfortunately, few methods exist to study visual perception in pre-clinical species. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to adapt a task of visual integration by proximity with relevance to schizophrenia to a rodent touchscreen environment to determine the effects of glutamatergic and GABAergic compounds. In this way, we could evaluate the effects of common models of cognitive impairment, as well as the effects of net excitation versus inhibition, on a task of visual integration. Method: Rats were trained to perform a visual discrimination where the stimuli were composed of rows of dots differing only in there horizontal and vertical proximity. Once stable performance had been achieved, animals were tested under the influence of glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs (ketamine, MK-801, PCP, memantine, chlordiazepoxide, or diazepam) while attempting to perform a visual discrimination with altered stimuli. Results: Ketamine appeared to impair perceptual grouping in this paradigm, while the GABA agonist chlordiazepoxide enhanced grouping even in the presence of non-selective effects. Conclusions: In general, these findings support the theory that NMDA antagonists may disrupt visual grouping by proximity and highlight a potential beneficial effect of enhanced GABA activity in perception. However, additional research will be required to confirm the stimulus selectivity of this effect, and the clinical significance of this approach.

AB  - Horizontal cells in the mouse retina are of the axon-bearing B-type and contribute to the gain control of photoreceptors and to the center-surround organization of bipolar cells by providing feedback and feedforward signals to photoreceptors and bipolar cells, respectively. Horizontal cells form two independent networks, coupled by dendro-dendritic and axo-axonal gap junctions composed of connexin57 (Cx57). In Cx57-deficient mice, occasionally the residual tracer coupling of horizontal cell somata was observed. Also, negative feedback from horizontal cells to photoreceptors, potentially mediated by connexin hemichannels, appeared unaffected. These results point to the expression of a second connexin in mouse horizontal cells. We investigated the expression of Cx50, which was recently identified in axonless A-type horizontal cells of the rabbit retina. In the mouse retina, Cx50-immunoreactive puncta were predominantly localized on large axon terminals of horizontal cells. Electron microscopy did not reveal any Cx50-immunolabeling at the membrane of horizontal cell tips invaginating photoreceptor terminals, ruling out the involvement of Cx50 in negative feedback. Moreover, Cx50 colocalized only rarely with Cx57 on horizontal cell processes, indicating that both connexins form homotypic rather than heterotypic or heteromeric gap junctions. To check whether the expression of Cx50 is changed when Cx57 is lacking, we compared the Cx50 expression in wildtype and Cx57-deficient mice. However, Cx50 expression was unaffected in Cx57-deficient mice. In summary, our results indicate that horizontal cell axon terminals form two independent sets of homotypic gap junctions, a feature which might be important for light adaptation in the retina.

AB  - Cortical gamma band oscillations (GBO, 30-80 Hz, typically ~40 Hz) are involved in higher cognitive functions such as feature binding, attention, and working memory. GBO abnormalities are a feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with dysfunction of cortical fast-spiking interneurons containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). GBO vary according to the state of arousal, are modulated by attention, and are correlated with conscious awareness. However, the subcortical cell types underlying the state-dependent control of GBO are not well understood. Here we tested the role of one cell type in the wakefulness-promoting basal forebrain (BF) region, cortically projecting GABAergic neurons containing PV, whose virally transduced fibers we found apposed cortical PV interneurons involved in generating GBO. Optogenetic stimulation of BF PV neurons in mice preferentially increased cortical GBO power by entraining a cortical oscillator with a resonant frequency of ~40 Hz, as revealed by analysis of both rhythmic and nonrhythmic BF PV stimulation. Selective saporin lesions of BF cholinergic neurons did not alter the enhancement of cortical GBO power induced by BF PV stimulation. Importantly, bilateral optogenetic inhibition of BF PV neurons decreased the power of the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response, a read-out of the ability of the cortex to generate GBO used in clinical studies. Our results are surprising and novel in indicating that this presumptively inhibitory BF PV input controls cortical GBO, likely by synchronizing the activity of cortical PV interneurons. BF PV neurons may represent a previously unidentified therapeutic target to treat disorders involving abnormal GBO, such as schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Patients with and at risk for psychosis may have difficulty using associative strategies to facilitate episodic memory encoding and recall. In parallel studies, patients with first-episode schizophrenia (n = 27) and high psychosis risk (n = 28) compared with control participants (n = 22 and n = 20, respectively) underwent functional MRI during a remember-know memory task. Psychophysiological interaction analyses, using medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures as regions of interest, were conducted to measure functional connectivity patterns supporting successful episodic memory. During encoding, patients with first-episode schizophrenia demonstrated reduced functional coupling between MTL regions and regions involved in stimulus representations, stimulus selection, and cognitive control. Relative to control participants and patients with high psychosis risk who did not convert to psychosis, patients with high psychosis risk who later converted to psychosis also demonstrated reduced connectivity between MTL regions and auditory-verbal and visual-association regions. These results suggest that episodic memory deficits in schizophrenia are related to inefficient recruitment of cortical connections involved in associative memory formation; such deficits precede the onset of psychosis among those individuals at high clinical risk.

AB  - Background: Visual hallucinations are an important non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and carry a negative prognosis. Their biological basis is uncertain, but may relate to the activity of resting state networks in brain. We therefore aimed to investigate functional activity of brain in patients with visual hallucinations (PDVH) in resting state compared to patients without hallucinations (PDnonVH) and a healthy control group (HC). Methods: Resting state functional MRI was acquired and the primary analysis compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across groups. This informed a secondary analysis, in the PD groups only, comparing functional connectivity between a 'seed' region in the occipital lobe and the rest of the brain. Results: Individuals with PDVH showed lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus and greater ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, medial temporal gyrus and cerebellum than PDnonVH and HC. PDnonVH also had lower ALFF in occipitoparietal region and greater ALFF in medial temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal and cerebellum regions than HC. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, although both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity relative to the HC group, occipital - corticostriatal connectivity was significantly higher in those with PDVH compared with PDnonVH. Conclusion: Our study reveals widespread hemodynamic alterations in PD. However, within a functionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions. These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD.

AB  - Background: Abnormalities in gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) have been proposed to reflect neural circuitry abnormalities in schizophrenia. Oscillations in the gamma band are thought to play an important role in visual perception, mediating the binding of visual features into coherent objects. However, there is relatively little evidence to date of deficits in gamma-mediated processes associated with Gestalt perception in schizophrenia. Methods: Fourteen healthy control subjects (HC) and 17 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) discriminated between illusory Kanisza Squares and No-Square control stimuli, indicating their judgment with a manual button press. Time-frequency decomposition of the EEG was computed with the Morlet wavelet transform. Time-frequency maps of phase locking factor (PLF) values were calculated for stimulus- and response-locked oscillations. Results: HC and SZ did not differ in reaction time, error rate, an early ERP effect associated with Gestalt processing, nor an early visual-evoked gamma oscillation. Two response-locked high gamma effects had greater PLF for Square than No-Square stimuli in HC, and the reverse pattern in SZ. One of these effects was correlated with thought disorder symptom ratings in SZ. Conclusions: SZ demonstrated abnormalities in gamma oscillations associated with the perception of Gestalt objects, while their early visual-evoked gamma activity was mostly normal, contrary to previous results. This study supports the hypothesis that high-frequency oscillations are sensitive to aspects of psychosis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual perception in schizophrenia is attracting a broad interest given the deep knowledge that we have about the visual system in healthy populations. One example is the class of effects known collectively as visual surround suppression. For example, the visibility of a grating located in the visual periphery is impaired by the presence of a surrounding grating of the same spatial frequency and orientation. Previous studies have suggested abnormal visual surround suppression in patients with schizophrenia. Given that schizophrenia patients have cortical alterations including hypofunction of NMDA receptors and reduced concentration of GABA neurotransmitter, which affect lateral inhibitory connections, then they should be relatively better than controls at detecting visual stimuli that are usually suppressed. We tested this hypothesis by measuring contrast detection thresholds using a new stimulus configuration. We tested two groups: 21 schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy subjects. Thresholds were obtained using Bayesian staircases in a four-alternative forced-choice detection task where the target was a grating within a 3degree Butterworth window that appeared in one of four possible positions at 5degree eccentricity. We compared three conditions, (a) target with no-surround, (b) target embedded within a surrounding grating of 20degree diameter and 25% contrast with same spatial frequency and orthogonal orientation, and (c) target embedded within a surrounding grating with parallel (same) orientation. Previous results with healthy populations have shown that contrast thresholds are lower for orthogonal and no-surround (NS) conditions than for parallel surround (PS). The logratios between parallel and NS thresholds are used as an index quantifying visual surround suppression. Patients performed poorly compared to controls in the NS and orthogonal-surround conditions. However, they performed as well as controls when the surround was parallel, resulting in significantly lower suppression indices in patients. To examine whether the difference in suppression was driven by the lower NS thresholds for controls, we examined a matched subgroup of controls and patients, selected to have similar thresholds in the NS condition. Patients performed significantly better in the PS condition than controls. This analysis therefore indicates that a PS raised contrast thresholds less in patients than in controls. Our results support the hypothesis that inhibitory connections in early visual cortex are impaired in schizophrenia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate a relationship between concentrations of homocysteine (HCY), vitamin B12 and folic acid and disturbances of cognitive functions during acute episode of bipolar depression. Methods: 116 patients were studied (93 women, 23 men), aged 20-78 (mean 51+/-13) years during acute episode of bipolar depression. Depression was evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The following tests measuring cognitive functions were applied: Trail Making Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. In all patients, the measurements of serum homocysteine, vitamin B12 and folic acid were carried out. Results: Hyperhomocystemia (HCY > 15 microM/l) was detected in 41 patients (35%), more frequently in men (52%) than in women (31%). Patients with hyperhomocysteinemia achieved worse results in sub-tests of WAIS-R (Verbal comprehension, perceptual organization). In men, negative correlation was found between HCY concentration and number of errors in Stroop Test, and WCST (total errors and non-perseverative errors). In women with bipolar disorder, type II, negative correlation between HCY concentration and time of Stroop Test, and between vitamin B12 concentration and number of errors in Stroop Test, were demonstrated. In the whole group and in men, there was positive correlation between higher folic acid concentration and the number of errors in Stroop Test. Conclusions: The results obtained show higher HCY concentration in considerable proportion of patients with bipolar depression, especially in men. They also confirm a connection between high homocysteine concentration and worse performance in some neuropsychological tests. Such relationship was more marked in men.

AB  - Preoperational features such as egocentric thinking and perception-bound reasoning have been implicated in the association between schizotypy and creativity. The objective of the study, therefore, was to study the relationships between schizotypy, creativity, egocentrism, and the 3 levels of perceptual processing: selection, organization, and interpretation. A sample of adults (N = 130) completed 6 assessments: Short Scales for Measuring Schizotypy, Wallach-Kogan Battery of Creativity Instruments, Selfism Scale, Stroop Test, Perceptual Organization Test, and Picture Arrangement Test. Positive schizotypy was found to be associated with 2 dimensions of creativity, Originality and Flexibility. Further, schizotypy correlated positively with egocentrism. Creativity on the other hand, was found to be associated with better performance on the perceptual tasks. A model has been proposed in which individuals differing on schizotypy and creativity are represented along the 2 intersecting axes of egocentrism and perceptual processing.

AB  - Abstract Specific language impairment (SLI) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects linguistic abilities when development is otherwise normal. We report the results of a genome-wide association study of SLI which included parent-of-origin effects and child genotype effects and used 278 families of language-impaired children. The child genotype effects analysis did not identify significant associations. We found genome-wide significant paternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 14q12 (P = 3.74 x 10-8) and suggestive maternal parent-of-origin effects on chromosome 5p13 (P = 1.16 x 10-7). A subsequent targeted association of six single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5 in 313 language-impaired individuals and their mothers from the ALSPAC cohort replicated the maternal effects, albeit in the opposite direction (P = 0.001); as fathers' genotypes were not available in the ALSPAC study, the replication analysis did not include paternal parent-of-origin effects. The paternally-associated SNP on chromosome 14 yields a non-synonymous coding change within the NOP9 gene. This gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that has been reported to be significantly dysregulated in individuals with schizophrenia. The region of maternal association on chromosome 5 falls between the PTGER4 and DAB2 genes, in a region previously implicated in autism and ADHD. The top SNP in this association locus is a potential expression QTL of ARHGEF19 (also called WGEF) on chromosome 1. Members of this protein family have been implicated in intellectual disability. In summary, this study implicates parent-of-origin effects in language impairment, and adds an interesting new dimension to the emerging picture of shared genetic etiology across various neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - In the primate retina, parasol ganglion cells contribute to the primary visual pathway via the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus, display ON and OFF concentric receptive field structure, nonlinear spatial summation, and high achromatic temporal-contrast sensitivity. Parasol cells may be homologous to the alpha-Y cells of nonprimate mammals where evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated synaptic excitation as well as glycinergic disinhibition play critical roles in contrast sensitivity, acting asymmetrically in OFF- but not ON-pathways. Here, light-evoked synaptic currents were recorded in the macaque monkey retina in vitro to examine the circuitry underlying parasol cell receptive field properties. Synaptic excitation in both ON and OFF types was mediated by NMDA as well as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors. The NMDA-mediated current-voltage relationship suggested high Mg2+ affinity such that at physiological potentials, NMDA receptors contributed ~20% of the total excitatory conductance evoked by moderate stimulus contrasts and temporal frequencies. Postsynaptic inhibition in both ON and OFF cells was dominated by a large glycinergic "crossover" conductance, with a relatively small contribution from GABAergic feedforward inhibition. However, crossover inhibition was largely rectified, greatly diminished at low stimulus contrasts, and did not contribute, via disinhibition, to contrast sensitivity. In addition, attenuation of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic inhibition left center-surround and Y-type receptive field structure and high temporal sensitivity fundamentally intact and clearly derived from modulation of excitatory bipolar cell output. Thus, the characteristic spatial and temporal-contrast sensitivity of the primate parasol cell arises presynaptically and is governed primarily by modulation of the large AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated excitatory conductance. Moreover, the negative feedback responsible for the receptive field surround must derive from a nonGABAergic mechanism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The goals of the present study were to assess the interrelationships among tasks from the MATRICS and CNTRACS batteries, to determine the degree to which tasks from each battery capture unique variance in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, and to determine the ability of tasks from each battery to predict functional outcome. Subjects were 104 schizophrenia patients and 132 healthy control subjects recruited as part of the CNTRACS initiative. All subjects completed four CNTRACS tasks and two tasks from the MATRICS battery: Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Functional outcome was also assessed in the schizophrenia subjects. In both the patient and control groups, we found significant intercorrelations between all higher order cognitive tasks (episodic memory, goal maintenance, processing speed, verbal learning) but minimal relationships with the visual task. For almost all tasks, scores were significantly related to measures of functional outcome, with higher associations between CNTRACS tasks and performance-based measures of function and between one of the MATRICS tasks and self-reported functioning, relative to the other functioning measures. After regressing out variance shared by other tasks, we continued to observe group differences in performance among task residuals, particularly for measures of episodic memory from both batteries, although these residuals did not correlate as robustly with functional outcome as raw test scores. These findings suggest that there exists both shared and specific variance across cognitive tasks related to cognitive and functional impairments in schizophrenia and that measures derived from cognitive neuroscience can predict functional capacity and status in schizophrenia.

AB  - In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a circle surrounded by smaller circles is perceived as larger than an identical one surrounded by larger circles. The illusion is reportedly weaker in individuals with (disorganized) schizophrenia or schizotypy than in controls, a finding that has been interpreted as evidence that both schizophrenia and schizotypy involve reduced contextual integration. In support of this view, we show that the Ebbinghaus illusion also decreases, in the general population, with cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits (measured with both the cognitive-perceptual subscale of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief and the Magical Ideation scale). Our results were strong and separately replicable in different within-subjects and between-subjects conditions. However, a mediation analysis revealed that the reduction of the Ebbinghaus illusion was (statistically, hence without implying a causal relationship) entirely due to increased judgment time, i.e., the time subjects took to complete size comparisons. Judgment time increased with the strength of cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits, but subjects with longer judgment times had smaller illusions regardless of these traits. We argue that there are at least two possible accounts of our results. Reduced contextual integration might be due to a reduced ability to integrate context, as previously suggested; alternatively, it could be due to a reduced tendency to integrate context-that is, to a detail-oriented processing style. We offer predictions for future research, testable with a deadline experiment that pits these two accounts against one another. Regardless of which account proves to be best, our results show that contextual integration decreases with cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits, and that this relationship is mediated by judgment time. Future studies should thus consider either manipulating or measuring this time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abnormal perceptual experiences are central to schizophrenia, but the nature of these anomalies remains undetermined. We investigated contextual processing abnormalities across a comprehensive set of visual tasks. For perception of luminance, size, contrast, orientation, and motion, we quantified the degree to which the surrounding visual context altered a center stimulus's appearance. Healthy participants showed robust contextual effects across all tasks, as evidenced by pronounced misperceptions of center stimuli. Schizophrenia patients exhibited intact contextual modulations of luminance and size but showed weakened contextual modulations of contrast, performing more accurately than controls. Strong motion and orientation context effects correlated with worse symptoms and social functioning. Importantly, the overall strength of contextual modulation across tasks did not differ between controls and schizophrenia patients. In addition, performance measures across contextual tasks were uncorrelated, implying discrete underlying processes. These findings reveal that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia is selective, arguing against the proposed unitary contextual processing dysfunction.

AB  - Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral and neurocognitive disorder in school-age children. Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most frequently prescribed CNS stimulant for ADHD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in intelligence quotient and domains of neurocognitive function after long-term MPH treatment of Taiwanese children with ADHD. Methods: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-III) was administrated twice at an interval of at least one year for all 171 subjects (6-12 years) and 47 age- and gender-matched children without ADHD. The ADHD-Rating scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) were also used at the time of enrolment, and at 6 months and one year later. Results: Taiwanese children with ADHD had lower Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Full IQ (FIQ) and performed poorly on several subtests of the WISC-III, including Similarities, Vocabulary, and Coding, compared to healthy children without ADHD. After one year of MPH treatment, significant decrements in all scores of the ADHD-Rating scale and CGI-S and increments in several domains of the WISC-III, including FIQ, VIQ, PIQ, Perceptual Organization Index (POI), Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and Digit Span were observed. When the ADHD children under MPH treatment were subdivided into two age groups (6-8 years and 9-12 years), significantly better performance in some subtests and subscales of the WISC-III (such as Similarities, Comprehension, and Object assembly) was found in the 6-8 years age group. Conclusions: Long-term MPH treatment may improve the neurocognitive profiles of the ADHD children, as seen in their performance in several subtests and in the IQ scores on the WISC-III. And this improvement had no correlation with the decrement of ADHD symptoms. Starting stimulant treatment at as young an age as possible is advised due to the greater benefits in the 6-8 years age group, as seen in this study. More research in this area is also needed to confirm these results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Anomalous perception has been investigated extensively in schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether these impairments are specific to schizophrenia or extend to other psychotic disorders. Recent studies of visual context processing in schizophrenia (Tibber et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013) point to circumscribed, task-specific abnormalities. Here we examined visual contextual processing across a comprehensive set of visual tasks in individuals with bipolar disorder and compared their performance with that of our previously published results from schizophrenia and healthy participants tested on those same tasks. We quantified the degree to which the surrounding visual context alters a center stimulus' appearance for brightness, size, contrast, orientation and motion. Across these tasks, healthy participants showed robust contextual effects, as indicated by pronounced misperceptions of the center stimuli. Participants with bipolar disorder showed contextual effects similar in magnitude to those found in healthy participants on all tasks. This result differs from what we found in schizophrenia participants (Yang et al., 2013) who showed weakened contextual modulations of contrast but intact contextual modulations of perceived luminance and size. Yet in schizophrenia participants, the magnitude of the contrast illusion did not correlate with symptom measures. Performance on the contrast task by the bipolar disorder group also could not be distinguished from that of the schizophrenia group, and this may be attributed to the result that bipolar patients who presented with greater manic symptoms showed weaker contrast modulation. Thus, contrast gain control may be modulated by clinical state in bipolar disorder. Stronger motion and orientation context effects correlated with worse clinical symptoms across both patient groups and especially in schizophrenia participants. These results highlight the complexity of visual context processing in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Impairments in visual perceptual organization abilities are a repeatedly observed cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. These impairments have been found to be most prominent among patients with histories of poor premorbid social functioning, disorganized symptoms, and poor clinical outcomes. Despite the demonstration of significant sex differences for these clinical factors in schizophrenia, the extent of sex differences for visual perceptual organization in schizophrenia is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the extent to which previously known correlates (premorbid social sexual functioning and disorganized symptoms) and a novel factor (participant sex) accounted for performance on two perceptual organization tasks (contour integration and Ebbinghaus illusion) that have previously demonstrated sensitivity to schizophrenia. We also determined the relative degree to which each of these factors predicted task scores over and above the others. Schizophrenia patients (N = 109, 43 females) from different levels of care were ascertained. Female patients demonstrated higher contour integration scores, but lower performance on the context sensitivity index of the Ebbinghaus illusion, compared to males. Contour integration performance was significantly associated with poorer premorbid adolescent social sexual functioning and higher levels of disorganized symptoms, supporting past results that indicate a relationship among poor premorbid social sexual functioning, disorganized symptoms, and visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia. However, analyses of Ebbinghaus illusion performance suggests there is a complex relationship among patient sex, clinical factors and perceptual abilities with relatively intact bottom-up grouping processes in females, but greater problems, compared to males with more top-down mediated context sensitivity. Therefore, sex differences may be an important consideration for future studies of visual perceptual organization in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rationale: Visual perception is impaired during pathological psychosis, which can be mimicked by NMDA receptor antagonists. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, partly due to limits of current rodent models for visual integration. Objectives: The objectives of the study are (1) to develop a rodent task that can differentiate between effects on perception and nonspecific effects on task performance and (2) to test whether NMDA receptor antagonists affect visual perception in rats. Methods: We used an adaptation of Glass patterns to assess visual grouping in rats using a two-choice visual discrimination task in an infrared touch screen conditioning chamber. After rats learned to discriminate between a radial and a concentric bipole pattern, the ability to discriminate between these patterns was tested at various levels of distortion and a psychometric function was fit to obtain the maximum task performance and signal level needed for half-maximum performance. Results: NMDA receptor antagonists ketamine and phencyclidine at low doses increased the signal quality needed to discriminate between the visual patterns, without affecting the ability to discriminate between undistorted images. At higher doses, the ability to perform the task even with undistorted images was impaired, which was associated with stereotypic behaviour and increased impulsivity. Conclusions: The Glass pattern-based visual grouping task is able to differentiate the effect of psychotomimetic NMDA receptor antagonists on visual perception from the effects on motor and memory functions. The half-maximum performance signal level allows quantification of cognitive psychosis in rodents, which can be translated to human psychometric functions and can be used in the development of more effective treatments.

AB  - Introduction: In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a shape appears larger than its actual size when surrounded by small shapes and smaller than its actual size when surrounded by large shapes. Resistance to this visual illusion has been previously reported in schizophrenia, and linked to disorganized symptoms and poorer prognosis in cross-sectional studies. It is unclear, however, when in the course of illness this resistance first emerges or how it varies longitudinally with illness phase. Method: We addressed these issues by having first-episode psychosis patients, multiple-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls complete a psychophysical task at two different time points, corresponding to hospital admission and discharge for patients. The task required judging the relative size of two circular targets centered on either side of the screen. Targets were presented without context (baseline), or were surrounded by shapes that made the size judgment harder or easier (misleading and helpful contexts, respectively). Context sensitivity was operationalized as the amount of improvement relative to baseline in the helpful condition minus the amount of decrement relative to baseline in the misleading condition. Results: At hospital admission, context sensitivity was lower in the multiple-episode group than in the other groups, and was marginally less in the first episode than in the control group. In addition, schizophrenia patients were significantly more and less accurate than the other groups in the misleading and helpful conditions, respectively. At discharge, all groups exhibited similar context sensitivity. In general, poorer context sensitivity was related to higher levels of disorganized symptoms, and lower level of depression, excitement, and positive symptoms. Discussion: Resistance to the Ebbinghaus illusion, as a characteristic of the acute phase of illness in schizophrenia, increases in magnitude after the first episode of psychosis. This suggests that visual context processing is a state-marker in schizophrenia and a biomarker of relapse and recovery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an editorial by David Nutt et al. (see record 2013-29974-004). It has been noted that a treatment that impacts both positive symptoms and cognitive impairments would probably be accused of pseudo-specificity, and thus have a more difficult regulatory approval path. Nutt et al. strongly disagree, as do the current authors. They do not think that it is a coincidence that both symptoms and worsening of cognitive status arise in tandem during a prodromal period. In fact, they think that it is plausible that there is some shared, but yet to be determined pathophysiology and view the latter as an underappreciated "holy grail." If this is indeed the case, then a treatment might impact both these domains. One area not covered in depth in the report by Nutt et al. relates to a large US based initiative, called CNTRICS that was designed to develop tests that reflect advances in cognitive neuroscience, and as such might more precisely assay neural systems or neurochemical status.

AB  - The authors of other chapters in this book have made it very clear that cognition is a core part of schizophrenia, related to key genetic and biological mechanisms, and a prime driver of the dysfunction and disability that characterizes the course of schizophrenia. Yet, as of the printing of this book, there are no treatments for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Antipsychotic medications have very little impact on cognitive impairment in chronic schizophrenia, and their benefits in first-episode schizophrenia are small and related to the symptom improvement found in early-phase treatment. Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is thus a tremendous unmet need. Scores of pharmaceutical and device companies and government agencies have been involved in funding studies that may identify a treatment that can benefit cognition in patients with schizophrenia. These efforts have been facilitated by an interdisciplinary consortium, originally funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, called the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) project. The MATRICS project identified tests that would best measure cognition in clinical trials and outlined clinical trial designs believed to best test the treatment effects of a compound on cognition in patients with schizophrenia . The MATRICS group determined that the best design for testing the effects of pharmacological treatment on cognition in schizophrenia is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients who are clinically stable and who are receiving stable doses of antipsychotic medication, the so-called "add-on" or "co-treatment" design. Of course, a single treatment that could reduce symptoms and improve cognition would be ideal, but the regulatory path for this type of clinical trial was viewed as more complex and has presented a higher hurdle for development due to regulatory concerns that cognitive benefit in the context of symptom amelioration is likely a secondary effect of symptom reduction, referred to as a pseudospecific effect (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perceptual organization, which refers to the ability to integrate fragments of stimuli to form a representation of a whole edge, part, or object, is impaired in schizophrenia. A contour integration paradigm, involving detection of a set of Gabor patches forming an oval contour pointing to the right or left embedded in a field of randomly oriented Gabors, has been developed for use in clinical trials of schizophrenia. The purpose of the present study was to assess contributions of early and later stages of processing to deficits in contour integration, as well as to develop an event-related potential (ERP) analog of this task. Twenty-one patients with schizophrenia and 28 controls participated. The Gabor elements forming the contours were given a low or high degree of orientational jitter, making it either easy or difficult to identify the direction in which the contour was pointing. ERP results showed greater negative peaks at ~165 (N1 component) and ~270ms for the low-jitter versus the high-jitter contours, with a much greater difference between jitter conditions at 270 ms. This later ERP component was previously termed Ncl for closure negativity. Source localization identified the Ncl in the lateral occipital object recognition area. Patients showed a significant decrease in the Ncl, but not N1, compared to controls, and this was associated with impaired behavioral ability to identify contours. In addition, an earlier negative peak was found at ~120ms (termed N120) that differentiated jitter conditions, had a dorsal stream source, and differed between patients and controls. Patients also showed a deficit in the dorsal stream sensory P1 component. These results are in accord with impairments in distributed circuitry contributing to perceptual organization deficits and provide an ERP analog to the behavioral contour integration task.

AB  - Lateral inhibition produces the centre-surround organization of retinal receptive fields, in which inhibition driven by the mean luminance enhances the sensitivity of ganglion cells to spatial and temporal contrast. Surround inhibition is generated in both synaptic layers; however, the synaptic mechanisms within the inner plexiform layer are not well characterized within specific classes of retinal ganglion cell. Here, we compared the synaptic circuits generating concentric centre-surround receptive fields in ON and OFF brisk-sustained ganglion cells (BSGCs) in the rabbit retina. We first characterized the synaptic inputs to the centre of ON BSGCs, for comparison with previous results from OFF BSGCs. Similar to wide-field ganglion cells, the spatial extent of the excitatory centre and inhibitory surround was larger for the ON than the OFF BSGCs. The results indicate that the surrounds of ON and OFF BSGCs are generated in both the outer and the inner plexiform layers. The inner plexiform layer surround inhibition comprised GABAergic suppression of excitatory inputs from bipolar cells. However, ON and OFF BSGCs displayed notable differences. Surround suppression of excitatory inputs was weaker in ON than OFF BSGCs, and was mediated largely by GABAC receptors in ON BSGCs, and by both GABAA and GABAC receptors in OFF BSGCs. Large ON pathway-mediated glycinergic inputs to ON and OFF BSGCs also showed surround suppression, while much smaller GABAergic inputs showed weak, if any, spatial tuning. Unlike OFF BSGCs, which receive strong glycinergic crossover inhibition from the ON pathway, the ON BSGCs do not receive crossover inhibition from the OFF pathway. We compare and discuss possible roles for glycinergic inhibition in the two cell types. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this contribution I present three overlapping approaches to the phenomenology of the unconscious (Conrad, Binswanger, Husserl). Conrad and Binswanger challenge the classical view that the delusional perception in schizophrenia is an abnormal symbolic meaning attached to an otherwise intact percept. Rather, a perceptual aspect or expressive (physiognomic) quality, detached from its visual context, becomes salient and develops into the delusion. Both believe that the delusional object involves a transformation of perceptual Gestalt-meaning on a "lower" unconscious phase of its development but they apply different methods. Conrad appeals to contemporary experimental work on microgenesis (Aktualgenese). Binswanger applies Husserl's "genetic" phenomenology. Conrad describes the delusional object as a pre-Gestalt (Vorgestalt), a physiognomic-expressive Gestalt-quality arrested at an earlier phase in the development of meaning which "normally'" remains unconscious so far as consciousness remains intact. For Binswanger, the "delusional object" is formed from a sensory profile-aspect (Abschattung) released during the loosening of the perceptual object's internal structure (it's "internal horizon" of meaning). The phenomenological unconscious (Husserl) is two-pronged: it is both what underlies the lowermost background of any emergent Gestalt in the present, but it is also the past, the night of the unconscious, into which every emergent saliency passes. Time-consciousness is not the passive self-affection of pre-reflective self-awareness (M. Henry) but requires the unconscious relationship between present and past selves in the ongoing movement of self-transcendence. It is this self-transcendence which is both compromised and preserved by the metaphoric meaning of the delusional object in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Electrical stimulation of retinal neurons offers the possibility of partial restoration of visual function. Challenges in neuroprosthetic applications are the long-term stability of the metal-based devices and the physiological activation of retinal circuitry. In this study, we demonstrate electrical stimulation of different classes of retinal neurons with a multicapacitor array. The array-insulated by an inert oxide-allows for safe stimulation with monophasic anodal or cathodal current pulses of low amplitude. Ex vivo rabbit retinas were interfaced in either epiretinal or subretinal configuration to the multicapacitor array. The evoked activity was recorded from ganglion cells that respond to light increments by an extracellular tungsten electrode. First, a monophasic epiretinal cathodal or a subretinal anodal current pulse evokes a complex burst of action potentials in ganglion cells. The first action potential occurs within 1 ms and is attributed to direct stimulation. Within the next milliseconds additional spikes are evoked through bipolar cell or photoreceptor depolarization, as confirmed by pharmacological blockers. Second, monophasic epiretinal anodal or subretinal cathodal currents elicit spikes in ganglion cells by hyperpolarization of photoreceptor terminals. These stimuli mimic the photoreceptor response to light increments. Third, the stimulation symmetry between current polarities (anodal/cathodal) and retina-array configuration (epi/sub) is confirmed in an experiment in which stimuli presented at different positions reveal the center-surround organization of the ganglion cell. A simple biophysical model that relies on voltage changes of cell terminals in the transretinal electric field above the stimulation capacitor explains our results. This study provides a comprehensive guide for efficient stimulation of different retinal neuronal classes with low-amplitude capacitive currents.

AB  - Dysfunctional prediction in sensory processing has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism in the development of delusions in patients with schizophrenia. Previous studies in healthy subjects have shown that while the perception of apparent motion can mask visual events along the illusory motion trace, such motion masking is reduced when events are spatio-temporally compatible with the illusion, and, therefore, predictable. Here we tested the hypothesis that this specific detection advantage for predictable target stimuli on the apparent motion trace is reduced in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Our data show that, although target detection along the illusory motion trace is generally impaired, both patients and healthy control participants detect predictable targets more often than unpredictable targets. Patients had a stronger motion masking effect when compared to controls. However, patients showed the same advantage in the detection of predictable targets as healthy control subjects. Our findings reveal stronger motion masking but intact prediction of visual events along the apparent motion trace in patients with paranoid schizophrenia and suggest that the sensory prediction mechanism underlying apparent motion is not impaired in paranoid schizophrenia.

AB  - It has been postulated that horizontal cells (HCs) send feedback signals onto cones via a proton feedback mechanism, which generates the center-surround receptive field of bipolar cells, and color-opponent signals in many non-mammalian vertebrates. Here we used a strong pH buffer, HEPES, to reduce extra-cellular proton concentration changes and so determine whether protons mediate color-opponent signals in goldfish H3 (triphasic) HCs. Superfusion with 10 mM HEPES-fortified saline elicited depolarization of H3 HCs' dark membrane potential and enhanced hyperpolarizing responses to blue stimuli, but suppressed both depolarization by yellow and orange and hyperpolarization by red stimuli. The response components suppressed by HEPES resembled the inverse of spectral responses of H2 (biphasic) HCs. These results are consistent with the Stell-Lightfoot cascade model, in which the HEPES-suppressed component of H3 HCs was calculated using light responses recorded experimentally in H1 (monophasic) and H2 HCs. Selective suppression of long- or long- + middle-wavelength cone signals by long-wavelength background enhanced the responses to short-wavelength stimuli. These results suggest that HEPES inhibited color opponent signals in H3 HCs, in which the source of opponent-color signals is primarily a feedback from H2 HCs and partly from H1 HCs onto short-wavelength cones, probably mediated by protons.

AB  - Background: We sought to develop a Dot Pattern Expectancy task (DPX) to assess goal maintenance for use in clinical trials. Altering the standard task created 5 versions of the DPX to compare-a standard version and 4 others. Alterations in the interstimulus interval (ISI) length and the strength of a learned prepotent response distinguished the different tasks. These adjustments were designed to decrease administration time and/or improve reliability of the data. Methods: We determined participant eligibility in an initial session (the first of 3) using clinical interviewing tools. The initial session also included a demographic assessment and assessments of community functioning and symptom severity. All versions of the DPX were administered, across 3 sessions. Specific deficits on the context processing compared with difficulty control condition were evaluated using mixed-effects logistic regression within a hierarchical linear model. Results: We analyzed the data from 136 control participants and 138 participants with schizophrenia. Relative to a difficulty control condition, patients performed worse than controls on context processing conditions that required goal maintenance. ISI did not predict errors. Stronger prepotency was associated with increased errors in the difficulty control relative to context processing condition for controls, which improved the interpretability of findings for patients. Reliability was acceptable for a version of the task with a 10-minute running time. Conclusions: The best compromise between task duration and interpretability occurred on a version with a short ISI and a strong prepotency.

AB  - The Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative, funded by an R13 conference grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, has sought to facilitate the translation of measures from the basic science of cognition into practical brain-based tools to measure treatment effects on cognition in schizophrenia. In this overview article, we summarize the process and products of the sixth meeting in this series, which focused on the identification of promising imaging paradigms, based on the measurement of cognitive evoked potentials (event-related potential) of cognition-related time-frequency analyses of the electroencephalography as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging. A total of 23 well-specified paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that measure cognitive functions previously identified as targets for treatment development were identified at the meeting as being recommended for the further developmental work needed in order to validate and optimize them as biomarker measures. Individual paradigms are discussed in detail in 6 domain-based articles in this volume. Ongoing issues related to the development of these and other measures as valid, sensitive and reliable measurement, and assessment tools, as well as the steps necessary for the development of specific measures for use as biomarkers for treatment development and personalized medicine, are discussed.

AB  - Cone photoreceptors transmit signals at high temporal frequencies and mediate fine spatial vision. High-frequency transmission requires a high rate of glutamate release, which could promote spillover to neighboring cells, whereas spatial vision requires that cones within a tightly packed array signal light to postsynaptic bipolar cells with minimal crosstalk. Glutamate spread from the cone terminal is thought to be limited by presynaptic transporters and nearby glial processes. In addition, there is no ultrastructural evidence for chemical synapses between mammalian cones, although such synapses have been described in lower vertebrate retinas. We tested for cone-cone glutamate diffusion by recording from adjacent cone pairs in the ground squirrel retina, and instead found that the glutamate released by one cone during electrical stimulation activates glutamate transporter Cl- conductances on neighboring cones. Unlike in other systems, where crosstalk is diminished by increasing the temperature and by moving to a more intact preparation, glutamate spread persisted at physiological temperatures (37degreeC) and in retinal flat mounts. The glutamate-gated anion conductance in cones has a reversal potential of ~-30 mV compared with a cone resting potential of ~-50 mV; thus, crosstalk should have a depolarizing effect on the cone network. Cone-cone glutamate spread is regulated by the physiological stimulus, light, and under physiological conditions can produce a response of ~2 mV, equivalent to 13-20% of a cone's light response. We conclude that in the absence of discrete chemical synapses, glutamate flows between cones during a light response and may mediate a spatially distributed positive feedback.

AB  - In sensory systems, neurons are generally characterized by their receptive field, namely the sensitivity to activity patterns at the input of the circuit. To assess the role of the neuron in the system, one must also know its projective field, namely the spatiotemporal effects the neuron exerts on all of the outputs of the circuit. We studied both the receptive and projective fields of an amacrine interneuron in the salamander retina. This amacrine type has a sustained OFF response with a small receptive field, but its output projects over a much larger region. Unlike other amacrine cells, this type is remarkably promiscuous and affects nearly every ganglion cell within reach of its dendrites. Its activity modulates the sensitivity of visual responses in ganglion cells but leaves their kinetics unchanged. The projective field displays a center-surround structure: depolarizing a single amacrine suppresses the visual sensitivity of ganglion cells nearby and enhances it at greater distances. This change in sign is seen even within the receptive field of one ganglion cell; thus, the modulation occurs presynaptically on bipolar cell terminals, most likely via GABAB receptors. Such an antagonistic projective field could contribute to the mechanisms of the retina for predictive coding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Receptive field organization of cone-driven bipolar cells was investigated by intracellular recording in the intact light-adapted retina of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). Centered spots and concentric annuli of optimum dimensions were used to selectively stimulate the receptive field center and surround with sinusoidal modulations of contrast at 3 Hz. At low contrasts, responses of both the center and surround of both ON and OFF bipolar cells were linear, showing high gain and thus contrast enhancement relative to cones. The contrast/response curves for the fundamental response, measured by a Fast Fourier Transform, reached half maximum amplitude quickly at 13% contrast followed by saturation at high contrasts. The variation of the normalized amplitude of the center and surround responses was remarkably similar, showing linear regression over the entire response range with very high correlations, r2 = 0.97 for both ON and OFF cells. The contrast/response curves of both center and surround for both ON and OFF cells were well fit (r2 = 0.98) by an equation for single-site binding. In about half the cells studied, the nonlinear waveforms of center and surround could be brought into coincidence by scaling and shifting the surround response in time. This implies that a nonlinearity, common to both center and surround, occurs after polarity inversion at the cone feedback synapse. Evidence from paired whole-cell recordings between single cones and OFF bipolar cells suggests that substantial nonlinearity is not due to transmission at the cone synapse but instead arises from intrinsic bipolar cell and network mechanisms. When sinusoidal contrast modulations were applied to the center and surround simultaneously, clear additivity was observed for small responses in both ON and OFF cells, whereas the interaction was strikingly nonadditive for large responses. The contribution of the surround was then greatly reduced, suggesting attenuation at the cone feedback synapse. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Lateral interactions at the first retinal synapse have been initially proposed to involve GABA by transporter-mediated release from horizontal cells, onto GABAA receptors expressed on cone photoreceptor terminals and/or bipolar cell dendrites. However, in the mammalian retina, horizontal cells do not seem to contain GABA systematically or to express membrane GABA transporters. We here report that mouse retinal horizontal cells express GAD65 and/or GAD67 mRNA, and were weakly but consistently immunostained for GAD65/67. While GABA was readily detected after intracardiac perfusion, it was lost during classical preparation for histology or electrophysiology. It could not be restored by incubation in a GABA-containing medium, confirming the absence of membrane GABA transporters in these cells. However, GABA was synthesized de novo from glutamate or glutamine, upon addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a cofactor of GAD65/67. Mouse horizontal cells are thus atypical GABAergic neurons, with no functional GABA uptake, but a glutamate and/or glutamine transport system allowing GABA synthesis, probably depending physiologically from glutamate released by photoreceptors. Our results suggest that the role of GABA in lateral inhibition may have been underestimated, at least in mammals, and that tissue pre-incubation with glutamine and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate should yield a more precise estimate of outer retinal processing.

Patients underwent interview-based measures of psychiatric symptoms, nurses' observations of functioning, and measures of EC and traditional cognition (TC). Our results indicate that EC accounts for "real-world" functioning above that of TC and psychiatric symptoms. This observation supports the utility of incorporating salient measures that rely upon common experience and accumulated knowledge structure into existent test batteries.

AB  - Gap junctions are frequently observed in the adult vertebrate retina. It has been shown that gap junctions function as passive electrotonic pathways and play various roles, such as noise reduction, synchronization of electrical activities, regulation of the receptive field size, and transmission of rod signals to cone pathways. The presence of gap junctions between bipolar cells has been reported in various species but their functions are not known. In the present study, we applied dual whole-cell clamp techniques to the adult goldfish retina to elucidate the functions of gap junctions between ON-type bipolar cells with a giant axon terminal (Mb1-BCs). Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical experiments revealed that Mb1-BCs were coupled with each other through gap junctions that were located at the distal dendrites. The coupling conductance between Mb1-BCs under light-adapted conditions was larger than that under dark-adapted conditions. The gap junctions showed neither rectification nor voltage dependence, and behaved as a low-pass filter. Mb1-BCs could generate Ca2+ spikes in response to depolarization, especially under dark-adapted conditions. The Ca2+ spike evoked electrotonic depolarization through gap junctions in neighboring Mb1-BCs, and the depolarization in turn could trigger Ca2+ spikes with a time lag. A brief depolarizing pulse applied to an Mb1-BC evoked a long-lasting EPSC in the postsynaptic ganglion cell. The EPSC was shortened in duration when gap junctions were pharmacologically or mechanically impaired. These results suggest that the spread of Ca2+ spikes through gap junctions between bipolar cells may play a key role in lateral interactions in the adult retina.

AB  - Deficits in visual processing are now recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia. In the 1940s, Louis Thurstone developed a series of tests designed to evaluate specific aspects of visual perceptual processing including the Closure Flexibility Test (CFT), which was designed to measure "the ability to hold a configuration in mind despite distraction." The present study evaluated patients' performance on this task and its relationship to other tests of neuropsychological function, particularly to a measure of sustained visual attention. Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 40 controls participated. The CFT was administered both in its original form (10min) and also in a briefer form (3min) in which only a portion of stimuli were given. Patients showed highly significant large effect-size deficits on both the original (d = 1.6) and brief (d = 1.2) CFT. Between-group deficits in performance survived co-variation for IQ. In addition, the CFT score was significantly related to performance on the MATRICS measure of attention/vigilance, the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs version (CPT-IP). This correlation remained significant even after controlling for non-specific intercorrelations among neurocognitive measures. Results confirm the severity of early visual processing deficits in schizophrenia. In addition, the CFT is a brief, easy to administer alphabet-independent, paper-and-pencil test with established psychometric properties that may be useful as an index of the sustained visual attention construct in schizophrenia.

AB  - Horizontal cells (HCs) are involved in establishing the center-surround receptive field organization of photoreceptor and bipolar cells. In many species, HCs respond differentially to colors and may play a role in color vision. An earlier study from our laboratory suggested that four types of HCs exist in the zebrafish retina: three cone HCs (H1, H2 and H3) and one rod HC. In this study, we describe their photoreceptor connections. Cones are arranged in a mosaic in which rows of alternating blue (B)- and ultraviolet (UV)- sensitive single cones alternate with rows of red (R)- and green (G)-sensitive double cones; the G cones are adjacent to UV cones and B cones adjacent to R cones. Two small-field (H1 and H2) and two large-field (H3 and rod HC) cells were observed. The cone HC dendritic terminals connected to cones with single boutons, doublets, or rosettes, whereas the rod HCs connected to rods with single boutons. The single boutons/doublets/rosettes of cone HCs were arranged in double rows separated by single rows for H1 cells, in pairs and singles for H2 cells, and in a rectilinear pattern for H3 cells. These connectivity patterns suggest that H1 cells contact R, G, and B cones, H2 cells G, B, and UV cones, and H3 cells B and UV cones. These predictions were confirmed by applying the Dil method to SWS1-GFP retinas whose UV cones express green fluorescent protein. Each rod HC was adjacent to the soma or axon of a Dil-labeled cone HC and connected to 50-200 rods. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Following the discovery of context-dependent synchronization of oscillatory neuronal responses in the visual system, the role of neural synchrony in cortical networks has been expanded to provide a general mechanism for the coordination of distributed neural activity patterns. In the current paper, we present an update of the status of this hypothesis through summarizing recent results from our laboratory that suggest important new insights regarding the mechanisms, function and relevance of this phenomenon. In the first part, we present recent results derived from animal experiments and mathematical simulations that provide novel explanations and mechanisms for zero and nero-zero phase lag synchronization. In the second part, we shall discuss the role of neural synchrony for expectancy during perceptual organization and its role in conscious experience. This will be followed by evidence that indicates that in addition to supporting conscious cognition, neural synchrony is abnormal in major brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. We conclude this paper with suggestions for further research as well as with critical issues that need to be addressed in future studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the primate retina the small bistratified, "blue-yellow" color-opponent ganglion cell receives parallel ON-depolarizing and OFF-hyperpolarizing inputs from short (S)-wavelength sensitive and combined long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptors, respectively. However, the synaptic pathways that create S versus LM cone-opponent receptive field structure remain controversial. Here, we show in the macaque monkey retina in vitro that at photopic light levels, when an identified rod input is excluded, the small bistratified cell displays a spatially coextensive receptive field in which the S-ON-input is in spatial, temporal, and chromatic balance with the LM-OFF-input. ON pathway block with L-AP-4, the mGluR6 receptor agonist, abolished the S-ON response but spared the LM-OFF response. The isolated LM component showed a center-surround receptive field structure consistent with an input from OFF-center, ON-surround "diffuse" cone bipolar cells. Increasing retinal buffering capacity with HEPES attenuated the LM-ON surround component, consistent with a non-GABAergic outer retina feedback mechanism for the bipolar surround. The GABAa/c receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine did not affect chromatic balance or the basic coextensive receptive field structure, suggesting that the LM-OFF field is not generated by an inner retinal inhibitory pathway. We conclude that the opponent S-ON and LM-OFF responses originate from the excitatory receptive field centers of S-ON and LM-OFF cone bipolar cells, and that the LM-OFF- and ON-surrounds of these parallel bipolar inputs largely cancel, explaining the small, spatially coextensive but spectrally antagonistic receptive field structure of the blue-ON ganglion cell.

AB  - Center-surround antagonistic receptive field (CSARF) organization is the basic synaptic circuit that serves as elementary building blocks for spatial information processing in the visual system. Cells with such receptive fields converge into higher-order visual neurons to form more complex receptive fields. Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) are the first neurons along the visual pathway that exhibit CSARF organization. BCs have been classified according to their response polarities and rod/cone inputs, and they project signals to target cells at different sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer. On the other hand, CSARFs of various types of BCs have been assumed be organized the same way. Here we examined center and surround responses of over 250 salamander BCs, and demonstrated that different types of BCs exhibit different patterns of dye coupling, receptive field center size, surround response strength, and conductance changes associated with center and surround responses. We show that BC receptive field center sizes varied with the degree of BC-BC coupling, and that surround responses of different BCs are mediated by different combinations of five lateral synaptic pathways mediated by the horizontal cells and amacrine cells. The finding of heterogeneous receptive field circuitry fundamentally challenges the common assumption that CSARFs of different subtypes of visual neurons are mediated by the same synaptic pathways. BCs carrying different visual signals use different synaptic circuits to process spatial information, allowing shape and contrast computation be differentially modulated by various lighting and adaptation conditions.

Three scoring categories--Perceptual Organization, Perceptual Range, and Perceptual Personalization-- are used to identify participants' varying degrees of mental illness. Dana's system can be scored with high interrater reliability by a psychologically naive clerk. Using five different TAT cards for men and for women, Dana has shown good criterion-related validity and cross-validation, correctly placing individuals into clinical groups (i.e., normal, neurotic, and psychotic) a large percentage of the time. Dana's system also has utility in the domain of personality research; both applications continue to be relevant today. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The distinctive parasol ganglion cell of the primate retina transmits a transient, spectrally nonopponent signal to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Parasol cells show well-recognized parallels with the alpha-Y cell of other mammals, yet two key alpha-Y cell properties, a collateral projection to the superior colliculus and nonlinear spatial summation, have not been clearly established for parasol cells. Here, we show by retrograde photodynamic staining that parasol cells project to the superior colliculus. Photostained dendritic trees formed characteristic spatial mosaics and afforded unequivocal identification of the parasol cells among diverse collicular-projecting cell types. Loose-patch recordings were used to demonstrate for all parasol cells a distinct Y-cell receptive field "signature" marked by a nonlinear mechanism that responded to contrast-reversing gratings at twice the stimulus temporal frequency [second Fourier harmonic (F2)] independent of stimulus spatial phase. The F2 component showed high contrast gain and temporal sensitivity and appeared to originate from a region coextensive with that of the linear receptive field center. The F2 spatial frequency response peaked well beyond the resolution limit of the linear receptive field center, showing a Gaussian center radius of ~15 microm. Blocking inner retinal inhibition elevated the F2 response, suggesting that amacrine circuitry does not generate this nonlinearity. Our data are consistent with a pooled-subunit model of the parasol Y-cell receptive field in which summation from an array of transient, partially rectifying cone bipolar cells accounts for both linear and nonlinear components of the receptive field.

AB  - Over the past several years working in a milieu of schizophrenia-oriented research and medical venues, we have witnessed a number of incidents in which a commonly occurring medical phenomenon known as myodesopsia (i.e., floaters), leads to considerable confusion when rating perceptual abnormalities, even among the most seasoned of diagnosticians. Floaters occur when the vitreous, a gel-like substance that fills the eye, slowly shrinks and becomes stringy; the resulting strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina. There are the consistencies in the nature of a floater, which we have found to be very useful when distinguishing it from a genuine perceptual abnormality. The reliable and valid assessment of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders is a challenging and continuously evolving process; open communication between and among researchers and clinicians with phenomena such as floaters improve the reliability of research into visual illusions or perceptual distortions.

AB  - Genetically encoded optical neuromodulators create an opportunity for circuit-specific intervention in neurological diseases. One of the diseases most amenable to this approach is retinal degeneration, where the loss of photoreceptors leads to complete blindness. To restore photosensitivity, we genetically targeted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2, to second-order neurons, ON bipolar cells, of degenerated retinas in vivo in the Pde6brd1 (also known as rd1) mouse model. In the absence of 'classical' photoreceptors, we found that ON bipolar cells that were engineered to be photosensitive induced light-evoked spiking activity in ganglion cells. The rescue of light sensitivity was selective to the ON circuits that would naturally respond to increases in brightness. Despite degeneration of the outer retina, our intervention restored transient responses and center-surround organization of ganglion cells. The resulting signals were relayed to the visual cortex and were sufficient for the animals to successfully perform optomotor behavioral tasks.

AB  - This book, Exploring Psychology Fifth Edition in Modules really is Exploring Psychology, fifth edition--just in a different format. So, the modular book contains all the updated research and innovative new coverage from Exploring Psychology, fifth edition. A very few sections have moved around to accommodate the modular structure. For example, "Rates of Psychological Disorders" is a separate section at the end of the Psychological Disorders chapter in Exploring Psychology, fifth edition, but it is covered in the first of the Psychological Disorders and Their Treatment modules in the modular format. And "Improving Memory" is covered at the end of the Memory chapter in Exploring Psychology, fifth edition, but is covered at the end of the first memory module in Exploring Psychology Fifth Edition in Modules. Each module in this book is now self-standing rather than dependent upon any other part of the book. Cross references to other modules have been replaced with brief explanations. In some cases, illustrations or key terms are repeated to avoid possible confusion. No assumptions are made about what students have read prior to each module. This independence gives instructors ultimate flexibility in deciding which modules to use, and in what order. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The primate visual system consists of parallel pathways initiated by distinct cell types in the retina that encode different features of the visual scene. Small bistratified cells (SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow-OFF [S-ON/(L+M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high-acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center-surround spatial structure, with the (L+M)-OFF component of the receptive field ~50% larger in diameter than the S-ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S-ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF-parasol cells. The (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L-APB. These observations indicate that the (L+M)-OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF-bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON-parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to determine the psychometric properties for the Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Second Edition (LOTCA-II) in a population of persons with schizophrenia. Method: Sixty-four participants with schizophrenia were administered the LOTCA-II at baseline, and 43 of these were randomly selected to undertake four more standardized measures of cognitive and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) functions to test convergent validity. One week later, 48 randomly selected participants from the total sample were readministered the LOTCA-II to determine test-retest reliability. Results: Substantial ceiling effects existed in 96% of LOTCA-II items. Cronbach's alpha for all six sub-tests ranged from .20 to .91; the alpha for the global scale was .90. Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from .49 to .89 for the subtests and .95 for the full LOTCA-II. Low to moderate correlations were found between LOTCA-II total score and scores on cognitive and IADL measures. No overall significant differences in subtest scores were found across participants differing in employment status. Conclusion: LOTCA-II performance is best interpreted in the context of total score. Further revision of the test items is recommended for a more reliable and valid use of the LOTCA-II in persons with schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Deficits in social/communications skills have been documented in schizophrenia, but it is unclear how these deficits relate to cognitive deficits and to everyday functioning. In the current study, social/communication skills performance was measured in 29 schizophrenia patients with a history of good vocational functioning (GVF) and 26 with a history of poor vocational functioning (PVF) using a role-play-based social skills assessment, the Maryland Assessment of Social Competence (MASC). A battery of standard cognitive tasks was also administered. MASC-indexed social skills were significantly impaired in PVF relative to GVF patients (odds ratio = 3.61, P < .001). Although MASC social skills performance was significantly associated with cognitive performance in domains of verbal ability, processing speed, and memory, the MASC nevertheless remained an independent predictor of vocational functioning even after controlling for cognitive performance. Social/communications skills predict vocational functioning history independently of cognitive performance, and social skills measures should be considered for inclusion in test batteries designed to predict everyday functioning in schizophrenia.

AB  - Comments on an article by Pomarol-Clotet et al (see record 2006-10900-016). Pomarol-Clotet et al reported a range of perceptual distortions in healthy volunteers following ketamine administration but did not report hallucinations. They concluded that ketamine does not reproduce the full picture of schizophrenia, but there are similarities in terms of referential thinking and negative symptoms. We also recently studied healthy volunteers following ketamine administration (Stone et al, 2006) and, although previously unpublished, recorded phenomenological changes, including verbatim descriptions of their experiences. In keeping with Pomarol-Clotet et al, ketamine induced a wide range of abnormal perceptual experiences. However, no volunteers reported true hallucinations, although several reported eidetic imagery, and most reported visual illusions. Most experienced severe distortions of time, believing that a minute was several hours in duration. They also showed blunting of affect and loss of emotional reactivity. Although we agree with Pomarol-Clotet et al that these drug-induced effects do not correspond directly to schizophrenic symptoms, we feel it would be remarkable if ketamine administration were to completely reproduce the idiopathic condition.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Despite more than 100 years of research, the mechanisms underlying visual masking are still largely unknown. Most explanations of masking rely on either low-level energy or high-level object recognition based models. Using the recently discovered feature inheritance and shine-through effects, I review psychophysical evidence that visual masking can also be related to the basics of object recognition such as grouping, figure-ground segmentation, and feature binding. Computer simulations suggest that masking effects can occur when redundant stimulus elements are eliminated from further processing when grouping elements to objects and segmenting these objects from the background. Surprisingly, even if targets are masked completely, some of their features can still be visible, being "inherited" to elements of the mask. This inheritance effect is attributed to the binding of features to objects. In schizophrenic patients, compared to healthy observers, visual masking can exert much stronger effects. Our results indicate that grouping and figure-ground segmentation processing are intact even under masked conditions. Our studies suggest that visual information processing in schizophrenics may be attributable to influences we are just beginning to explore.

AB  - Possibilities for dynamic psychophysical experimentation on the World-Wide Web are just beginning to be explored. We sought to develop a Web-based version of a contour integration test that is suitable for clinical studies, and to determine whether the previously described contour integration deficit in schizophrenia could be replicated using the new test. Fields of Gabor patches against a gray background were used as stimuli, and a closed contour had to be located within a noisy background. A two-alternative forced-choice paradigm was developed in which the subject had to identify which direction an egg-shaped contour was pointing. The signal-to-noise ratio of the images, and the spacing between contour elements were kept constant, but the orientation of the contour elements was varied as the critical manipulation. The program to administer the task and record data was implemented within Java. Past results of a contour integration deficit in schizophrenia were replicated. Potential future uses of this test for clinical and research purposes are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this chapter, we present a method we developed to quantify and characterize the amount and types of thought pathology in responses to the Rorschach inkblots, called the Thought Disorder Index (TDI). The TDI classifies and weights responses to the Rorschach blots according to their pathological significance. The 23 categories of thought disorder and responses can be given weights according to their severity on a 4-point scale (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0). The rationale for the presumed sensitivity to thought disorder of the TDI assumes that patients responding to the Rorschach plates first have an associative apprehension of the amorphous stimuli. This associative process is followed by an effort to organize and elaborate the initial impression. Finally, patients attempt to verbalize the confluence of the perceptual and associative impressions in their responses. Interference by psychopathology with the process of organizing a response at any of these stages will result in thought slippage, such as inappropriate reasoning and disruptions in attending, or peculiarities in concept formation, perceptual organization, and verbalization. The TDI provides a metric for the quantity and quality of disturbance of thinking based on responses to Rorschach's plates. It is sensitive to the various forms of thought disorder found in putatively different conditions, such as schizophrenia and mania. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

However, in fact, he had already had two long, entirely different, and very distinguished careers before he began his research in schizophrenia: one as a clinical psychologist immersed in psychoanalytic metapsychology and treatment, and one as a researcher who characterized and probed individual differences in perceptual organization. For anyone who knew Dr. Holzman, it will come as no surprise that these two seemingly disparate interests, the humanistic world of the clinician and the empirical world of the researcher, continued to coexist throughout his career. One of Dr. Holzman's most lasting legacies to the scientific community was his endless capacity for collaborating with colleagues and for mentoring students. His many contributions to the fields of psychology, psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience, including his love of teaching others, will serve as a lasting legacy to the entire scientific community.

PY  - 2005
AB  - The cerebral cortex consists of a large number of areas, each subserving a more or less distinct function. This view has its roots in the early work of Penfield, and today is reflected in the body of functional MRI literature describing the regions of the brain that are activated during particular tasks, percepts, actions or thoughts. Moreover, the currently held view is that these areas, and their associated functions, are organized in a hierarchical fashion: some areas are low level, performing basic operations on the sensory input. Via feedforward cortico-cortical connections, this information is transferred to intermediate and high level areas, where more sophisticated processes occur, like object recognition, multi-sensory integration, decision making, attention, or reasoning. This view is now being challenged. Feedforward connections are reciprocated by numerous feedback fibers. Within areas, there are extensive horizontal connections that link neurons separated by large distances. Together, horizontal and feedback connections provide the anatomical basis for extensive recurrent processing, where low and high level information interacts. However, only recently we have gained some insight in how recurrent interactions work, and what their function might be. They provide cognitive operations, ranging from perceptual organization to awareness and attention. These insights have implications for understanding neurological and neuropsychological disease.

AB  - Gestalt-theory informed approaches towards the understanding of schizophrenia can go beyond the explanations of cognitive dysfunctions of the disorder. Deficits in Gestalt perception in schizophrenia may have a wider relevance for the understanding of the phenomenology of the disorder, especially for explanations of disturbances in self-experiences, as well as for the neurobiology of the condition. Phenomenological, cognitive and neurobiology data suggest that dysfunctional Gestalt perception in schizophrenia is linked to a wider disorganization of cognition and behaviour that may increase over the course of the disorder. In terms of specificity, we view deficits in Gestalt perception as consistent with the notions of 'function specificity' and 'stage specificity'. Future research should examine the neural correlates of dysfunctional Gestalt perception in relationship to aberrant activity in the gamma-band as well abnormalities in receptor functioning. This research will advance the understanding of the neurobiology of schizophrenia as well as stimulate novel therapeutic approaches. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Processing Speed Index (PSI) was first introduced on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WISC-III; D. Wechsler, 1991), and little is known about its clinical significance. In a referred sample (N = 980), children with neurological disorders (ADHD, autism, bipolar disorder, and LD) had mean PSI and Freedom from Distractibility Index (FDI) scores that were below the group mean IQ and lower than Verbal Comprehension (VCI) and Perceptual Organization (POI). For these groups, Coding was lower than Symbol Search. The majority of these children had learning, attention, writing, and processing speed weaknesses. This pattern was not found in the other clinical groups. For children with depression, only PSI was low. Children with anxiety disorders, oppositional-defiant disorder, and mental retardation had no PSI weakness. PSI and POI were both low in children with traumatic brain injury and spina bifida. Implications for a revision of the WISC-III (WISC-IV; D. Wechsler, 2003) are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Conducted several studies of impairments of visual integration in children and adults. It is known that abnormal binocular input leads to reduced visual acuity (usually in one eye only: the condition of amblyopia). In the first section we investigated how abnormal binocular input affects long-range cortical connectivity subserving visual integration. We found a selective loss in the contour integration abilities of patients with strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia, which also occur to a small degree in both eyes of patients with a history of strabismus who were not amblyopic at the time of testing. We also showed that the poor performance of amblyopic observers cannot be accounted for by deficiencies of a more local nature, such as a loss in visual acuity and in contrast sensitivity. In a re-test reliability study we also demonstrated that the card-based test of contour integration produces reliable estimates of contour integration performance in normal and amblyopic observers. In the second section we investigated: (1) schizophrenia patients' perceptual organization abilities using a psychophysically well-controlled measure of contour integration; (2) whether deficits in contour integration are due to impairments in early vision, in higher cognitive processes, or both; (3) whether repeated exposure to the stimuli leads to improved task performance; and (4) whether deficits in baseline performance and/or learning are similar in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The data provide further evidence for impaired perceptual grouping and reduced cognitive plasticity in schizophrenia. In the third section we investigated low-level visual function in Williams Syndrome (WMS). Although a dichotomy along dorsal/ventral functions has been proposed to explain the cognitive profile, recent neuroanatomical studies indicate that the most severe volumetric reductions in WMS are in the occipital lobe. These anatomical findings call for studies addressing early levels of visual processing in WMS. We reported our preliminary observations on behaviorally assessed primary visual cortex function in WMS. We found impaired primary visual cortex function, including deficits in both orientation discrimination and contour integration in WMS. We also proposed an outline for future research in this area which will include new techniques in order to bridge genes and behavior in WMS.

AB  - Surprisingly, the most effortless act of humans, seeing the world, seems to come very slowly to us. Contrary to common belief, although important visual functions emerge during the first year of life, the completion of visual development extends until the end of childhood. During this long period of plasticity, the visual system is particularly prone to suffer irreversible changes due to abnormal perceptual experience. The collection of studies in this volume have the common theme of mapping normal and abnormal visual development in terms of cortical connectivity patterns. The maturity of cortical connections is estimated by measuring the capacity to spatially integrate local features across the visual field in normally developing children, amblyopics, schizophrenics, and people with Williams syndrome. Aimed at researchers within the fields of developmental neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology and ophthalmology, this book will be an important first step in assessing intermediate level visual processes from a developmental perspective.

AB  - This commentary on UHLHAAS & SILVERSTEIN's (see record 2004-10586-003) Gestalt theoretical approach focuses on the problem of discovering specific dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Several categories of specificity are defined--deficits found in schizophrenia may be specific with respect to: a cognitive faculty or module (such as perception); a distributed neurocognitive function (e.g. binding); or a neurocognitive function depending on the temporal stage of the illness. It is argued that findings from various Gestalt psychological paradigms, including my own studies using apparent motion tasks, tend to support the latter notion of "stage specificity". Additionally, it is suggested that the Gestalt-informed approach to schizophrenia may profit from a broader nonlinear systems embedding (provided by synergetics and self-organization theory). Schizophrenia research may advance particularly by applying a variety of Gestalt paradigms not necessarily confined to perceptual grouping.

AB  - A rule of retinal wiring is that many receptors converge onto fewer bipolar cells and still fewer ganglion cells. However, for each S cone in macaque fovea, there are two S-cone ON bipolar cells and two blue-yellow (BY) ganglion cells. To understand this apparent rule reversal, we reconstructed synaptic patterns of divergence and convergence and determined the basic three-tiered unit of connectivity that repeats across the retina. Each foveal S cone diverges to four S-cone ON bipolar cells but contacts them unequally, providing 1-16 ribbon synapses per cell. Next, each bipolar cell diverges to two BY ganglion cells and also contacts them unequally, providing ~14 and ~28 ribbon synapses per cell. Overall, each S cone diverges to approximately six BY ganglion cells, dominating one and contributing more modestly to the others. Conversely, of each pair of BY ganglion cells, one is dominated by a single S cone and one is diffusely driven by several. This repeating circuit extracts blue/yellow information on two different spatiotemporal scales and thus parallels the circuits for achromatic, spatial vision, in which each cone dominates one narrow-field ganglion cell (midget) and contributes some input to several wider-field ganglion cells (parasol). Finally, because BY ganglion cells have coextensive +S and -(L+M) receptive fields, and each S cone contributes different weights to different BY ganglion cells, the coextensive receptive fields must be already present in the synaptic terminal of the S cone. The S-cone terminal thus constitutes the first critical locus for BY color vision. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Dysfunctions in Gestalt perception represent a specific deficit in the grouping of stimulus elements. Specifically, performance advantages of schizophrenia patients on measures of Gestalt perception disprove the prediction derived from the generalized deficit model (CHAPMAN & CHAPMAN, 1978). The explanation of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia in terms of a loss of the Gestalt structure may not be sufficient, however. Phenomenological data indicate that delusional perception, for example, may involve an abnormal organization of sensory information. In addition, dysfunctions in Gestalt perception may be relevant for the understanding of deficits in basic sensory processes as well as in higher cognitive functions, such as thinking and language, as well as for the explanation of affective disturbances. The heterogeneity of cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia can be accomodated by recent models of the pathophysiology of the disorder.

AB  - This first part of a two-part series presents a case that illustrates some of the difficulties that arise in extrapolating from the results of new drug registration trials to the real world of psychiatric practice. The patient was a 13-yr-old boy admitted to the hospital following an alleged suicide attempt. This was his 3rd admission over the preceding year. His first psychiatric hospitalization occurred at age 12 yrs and was occasioned by reports of persecutory hallucinations (PHs) and delusions. Upon discharge from his second admission, his diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder, with his medication regimen at that time being aripiprazole (60 mg/d) and fluoxetine (60 mg/d). At the 3rd admission he described PHs, visual illusions, and multiple nonsystematized or nonintegrated bizarre delusions principally involving family members. This article points out the complexity of interactions that can occur between just two drugs used in combination. Clinicians by necessity must frequently use medications in patients and situations what are quite different from the ones studied in drug registration trials. The importance of therapeutic drug monitoring is stressed. Uncertainty arises in determining whether a less than optional outcome occurs in spite of vs because of a treatment plan.

AB  - The authors submit a case report of a 62-yr-old male with an 18-mo history of a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. The patient experienced acute mental status changes which the authors conclude resulted from a regimen of quetiapine fumarate. He was started on quetiapine with incremental increases over 1 wk and was on 300 mg daily (twice daily dosing) for 3 days. Then for 4 days he experienced an inability to concentrate, distractibility, sleep-wake reversal, visual illusions of seeing a pen "become nothing" and appear "mushy," and tactile hallucinations of feeling a pen in his hand. Substance-induced delirium was the provisional diagnosis. The symptoms resolved within 48 hrs after discontinuing quetiapine. The close temporal relationship between onset of symptoms within 3 days of the 300 mg dosing and the resolution within 2 days following discontinuation leads the authors to associate quetiapine with the adverse mental changes. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of acute confusional states occurring during the initiation of quetiapine. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

However, each topic is also explored in enough depth to serve as a reference for professionals in the field, with full descriptions of the vocabulary, theoretical framework, and information-processing models of cognitive psychology and how they are applied to specific disorders. Each chapter provides an overview of the disorder being discussed, develops a rationale for selecting the stimulus materials, and demonstrates how a given patient's deficits can be understood in terms of a breakdown in one or more cognitive domains. The contributors offer step-by-step clinically oriented guidelines for disorders of attention, memory, language, spatial intelligence, calculation, motor control, and artistic ability.

AB  - Reports center-surround receptive fields of identified cone bipolar cells in the macaque monkey retina. In the peripheral retina, cone bipolar cell nuclei were labeled in vitro with diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI), targeted for recording under microscopic control, and anatomically identified by intracellular staining. Identified cells included 'diffuse' bipolar cells, which contact multiple cones, and 'midget' bipolar cells, which contact a single cone. Responses to flickering spots and annuli revealed a clear surround: both hyperpolarizing (OFF) and depolarizing (ON) cells responded with reversed polarity to annular stimuli. Center and surround dimensions were calculated for 12 bipolar cells from the spatial frequency response to drifting, sinusoidal luminance modulated gratings. Surrounds were around 10 times larger in diameter than centers and in most cases the ratio of center to surround strength was -1. It is suggested that the center-surround receptive fields of the major primate ganglion cell types are established at the bipolar cell, probably by the circuitry of the outer retina.

AB  - A retinal ganglion cell commonly expresses two spatially overlapping receptive field mechanisms. One is the familiar "center/surround," which sums excitation and inhibition across a region somewhat broader than the ganglion cell's dendritic field. This mechanism responds to a drifting grating by modulating firing at the drift frequency (linear response). Less familiar is the "nonlinear" mechanism, which sums the rectified output of many small subunits that extend for millimeters beyond the dendritic field. This mechanism responds to a contrast-reversing grating by modulating firing at twice the reversal frequency (nonlinear response). We investigated this nonlinear mechanism by presenting visual stimuli to the intact guinea pig retina in vitro while recording intracellularly from large brisk and sluggish ganglion cells. A contrast-reversing grating modulated the membrane potential (in addition to the firing rate) at twice the reversal frequency. This response was initially hyperpolarizing for some cells (either ON or OFF center) and initially depolarizing for others. Experiments in which responses to bars were summed in-phase or out-of-phase suggested that the single class of bipolar cells (either ON or OFF) that drives the center/surround response also drives the nonlinear response. Consistent with this, nonlinear responses persisted in OFF ganglion cells when ON bipolar cell responses were blocked by L-AP-4. Nonlinear responses evoked from millimeters beyond the ganglion cell were eliminated by tetrodotoxin. Thus, to relay the response from distant regions of the receptive field requires a spiking interneuron. Nonlinear responses from different regions of the receptive field added linearly.

PY  - 1998
AB  - The dendrites of ganglion cells initially ramify throughout the inner plexiform layer of the developing retina before becoming stratified into ON or OFF sublaminae. This ontogenetic event is thought to depend on glutamate-mediated afferent activity, because treating the developing retina with the glutamate analog 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB), which hyperpolarizes ON cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells, thereby preventing their release of glutamate, effectively arrests the dendritic stratification process. To assess the functional consequences of this manipulation, extracellular recordings were made from single cells in the A laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and from the optic tract in mature cats that had received intraocular injections of APB during the first postnatal month. Such recordings revealed that stimulation of the APB-treated eye evoked both ON as well as OFF discharges in 37% of the cells tested. (As expected, when the normal eye was activated, virtually all cells yielded only ON or OFF responses.) The proportion of ON-OFF cells found here corresponds closely to the incidence of multistratified dendrites observed previously in anatomical studies of APB-treated cat retinas. This suggests that the ganglion cells with multistratified dendrites receive functional inputs from ON as well as OFF cone bipolar cells. This interpretation is further supported by the finding that the proportion of ON-OFF cells was very similar in the geniculate layer innervated by the treated eye and in the optic tract. The cells activated by the APB-treated eye were also found not to show response suppression when flashing stimuli of increasing size were used. This suggests that exposing the developing retina to APB perturbs the neural circuitry mediating the antagonistic center-surround organization found in normal receptive fields. The functional changes evident after treating the developing retina with APB suggest that it should now be feasible to assess how the segregation of ON and OFF retinal pathways relates to organizational features at higher levels of the visual system, such as orientation selectivity in cortical cells.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that although schizophrenia patients can process aspects of visual form to which the visual system is "hard-wired" to respond, they are deficient in consolidating novel, unstructured visual information into memory traces, thus limiting the assessment of meaning and the generation of top-down influences to guide further processing. This hypothesis was tested with 18 chronic schizophrenia patients (mean age 40.11 yrs) and 18 controls (mean age 29.67 yrs), using a familiarity judgement task. As predicted, schizophrenia patients' ability to recognise a highly structured visual pattern increased as a function of experience. In contrast, recognition performance for an unstructured pattern did not improve even after 120 exposures. These data suggest that schizophrenia is characterised by a reduced ability to initiate experience-based changes in the visual system, wherein a group of noncontiguous elements that recur together and that are behaviourally relevant begins to be processed as a single unit. These data, and significant correlations between abnormal task performance and disorganised symptoms are consistent with recent neurophysiological models of schizophrenia.

AB  - The Sustained Attention Test (SSAT) is a vigilance task designed to assess the ability of individuals with schizophrenia to sustain attention to visual stimuli. The task requires the S to attend to 2 vertically adjacent squares on a computer monitor. Each square changes color at random intervals. The S's task is to respond when the 2 adjacent squares become the same color. 37 patients (mean age 44.23 yrs) completed the SSAT 1 or more times. The resulting data provide a straightforward assessment of sustained attention, and are not confounded by processes such as perceptual organization, working memory, or context processing, which are required by many other vigilance tasks. These data suggest that the SSAT is a psychometrically sound instrument. The SSAT had high test-retest reliability in this sample of chronic schizophrenia patients. In addition, test indices were strongly correlated with Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test indices of immediate memory span and total learning, and with learning and skill acquisition in a social skills training group. The SSAT may be a useful tool for screening schizophrenia patients to determine who may be best able to attend to and learn new information in psychosocial treatments.

AB  - Used the corneal electroretinogram and psychophysical increment-threshold spectral sensitivity functions to manipulate the inhibitory interaction between the red and green photoreceptors (R and G cones) of rhesus monkeys and humans. Red-green opponency (as measured by the depth of a notch at 580 nm) was removed by intravitreal injection of bicuculline but not by strychnine. Therefore, red-green opponency is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and not glycine. The depth of the notch was dependent on stimulus size. Red-green opponency was carried by the on and not the off bipolar pathways of the retina. Red and green annuli selectively reduced red and green inhibition, as though there were selective reduction of the surround response in center-surround organized red-green receptive fields.

AB  - Tested 3 alternative explanations concerning an apparent paranoid quality of extreme political attitudes: (a) such attitudes reflect exceptional, if embarrassing, perceptiveness by their proponents; (b) such attitudes reflect a cognitive style similar to that of paranoids without any attendant defensiveness; and (c) such attitudes represent paranoid defensiveness. Results with a selected total sample of 96 "left," "middle," and "right" undergraduates support only the 3rd hypothesis. Findings suggest that paranoid-like functioning was most prevalent in those on the extreme left. Paranoid defensiveness was indicated through an interaction with manipulated suspicion-arousal during assessment. Restrictions concerning the generalities of these results are discussed. (29 ref.)

Korsakoffs were most impaired in their scaling of olfactory and gustatory stimuli but did evidence some mild impairments on 2 of the 3 visual tasks. In contrast, right-hemisphere lesion patients were impaired on all 3 visual tasks and on an auditory task, but they scaled olfactory and gustatory stimuli in a normal manner. This dissociation indicated that the Korsakoffs' difficulties with the chemical senses cannot be attributed to the complexity of the tests.

Ss were asked about recent subjective changes in their perceptual and cognitive functioning. Responses were scored for presence or absence of specific perceptual and thinking disturbances, using verbatim typescripts and a standard raters' manual. Compared to nonschizophrenics, schizophrenics more often reported changes in the following: thought blocking which disrupts speech; mental fatigue; inability to focus attention; attribution of impaired concentration to factors other than preoccupation; visual illusions; misidentification of people; language not understood; more acute auditory perception; and impaired perception of speech. One-half of the schizophrenics reported an attentional deficit similar to that proposed by A. McGhie and J. Chapman as the primary disorder in schizophrenia.

AB  - Hypothesized that the deficit of poor premorbid schizophrenics in backward masking is due to interference in short-term visual memory (STVM) because of the tendency to process a pattern mask as if it were a cognitive mask. The hypothesis was tested in a backward-masking picture-recognition paradigm, using data from 32 male psychiatric patients (aged 18-55 yrs) and 14 hospital personnel. The 12 good premorbid schizophrenics, 7 nonschizophrenic psychotics, and normal Ss all showed differential pattern- and cognitive-mask performance. The performances of 13 poor premorbids were equivalent on both mask types. Findings corroborate the hypothesis. It is suggested that integration of stimuli in poor premorbids' sensory storage was intact and that the disruption in processing caused by a pattern mask at 200-300 msec was due to an interference in STVM. It is concluded that the hypothesis of a deficit in perceptual organization best accounts for the apparent disruptions in poor premorbids' STVM.

AB  - In this paper presented at the 5th Taniguchi International Symposium on Visual Science, Katata, Japan, in November-December 1982, the authors describe their study of the clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) retinas using intracellular recordings from photoreceptors and horizontal and bipolar cells. Cells were identified by injection of Lucifer yellow. Rod spectral sensitivity functions conformed to the density spectrum of a 524-nm pigment, those of cones to that of a 612-nm pigment. Horizontal cell responses reflected both these classes of photoreceptor input. Rod input evoked a slow waveform, cone input a faster waveform. In the mesopic state the horizontal response reflected both waveforms. A steady weak green background greatly enhanced the response to a superimposed red flash, but not the reverse. A 3rd photoreceptor type provided input to a chromatic bipolar cell that was hyperpolarized by blue light and depolarized by red light. These chromatic bipolars had broad areas of spatial integration and lacked center-surround organization. (15 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

These cells, which are said to have "double color-opponent receptive fields," are thought to play a major role in the analysis of colored images by enhancing simultaneous color contrast. This stage of information processing was heretofore considered to begin at the level of retinal ganglion cells. However, in the carp at least, this stage occurs earlier, as double color-opponent receptive fields have been found among the retinal bipolar cells of this animal.

AB  - The POT measures cognitive functioning as reflected in a purely perceptual task, while minimizing the influence of motor ability, which complicates other perceptual tests. Three series of abstract drawings are matched to 9 realistic drawings by placing the cards on which they are printed below the realistic equivalents; correctness of matching, orientation of the card, work time, and comments are recorded. A pilot study of the test was conducted on 112 normal Ss, 10 neurotics, 22 drug users, 6 acute schizophrenics, 22 regressed schizophrenics, and 6 Ss with brain dysfunction. Ages ranged from 12 to 63 yrs. Normal and neurotic Ss were most accurate, regressed schizophrenics worst, and Ss with brain dysfunction 2nd worst. Work time on the 3 parts varied among the groups, but generally the drug users were fastest, followed by the normal and neurotic Ss. A progressive decrease in work time over the 3 parts indicates a good prognosis. The test has proved useful in clinical experience, and can possibly be used to measure right-hemispheric functioning. Possible scoring refinements are mentioned. (12 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 15 paranoid and 15 nonparanoid schizophrenics and 15 normal controls were administered a size estimation task which featured 2 administrations of nonthematic standard stimuli presented under 3 conditions of background stimuli: (a) surrounded by 4 smaller stimuli of the same kind; (b) surrounded by 4 larger stimuli of the same kind; and (c) presented without background stimuli. Standard stimuli were presented at exposure times of 33 and 4,000 msec. On the 1st administration, nonparanoid schizophrenics overestimated size relative to paranoid schizophrenics; normal controls were intermediate in performance between the paranoid and nonparanoid schizophrenics, particularly on longer stimulus exposure times. The groups did not differ on the 2nd administration. Results suggest that the repeated administration of size estimation procedures in which the effects of sequence and thematic content stimuli were inextricably confounded may have contributed to recent conflicting findings in the size estimation literature. Contrary to predictions generated by R. L. Cromwell's (1972) stimulus redundancy formulation, the paranoid schizophrenics were not more affected by the size of the background stimuli than the nonparanoid schizophrenics.

AB  - Recorded visually evoked potentials from bipolar electrodes implanted in the foveal and parafoveal striate, prestriate, and inferotemporal cortices of 2 mature rhesus monkeys. The stimuli used were a blank field and 3 checkerboard patterns containing checks whose sizes were 2degree 24', 36degree 9' of visual arc. In addition to the size of the checks within the patterns, the intensity at which the stimuli were presented was also varied. In all 4 regions studied, check size had a significant effect on the amplitude of the average evoked potential, but intensity showed an effect only in the 2 striate regions. Certain regions of the visual cortex can apparently process 2 dimensions of a stimulus concurrently, and the same mass of neuronal tissue can participate in the processing of different dimensions of a stimulus at different times. Results are discussed in the context of existing literature concerning the evoked potential as an indicator of sensory information processing.

(b) There is a predictable course of early amnesia, disorientation, confusion, apraxia, and impaired perceptual organization. (c) Depression and other psychiatric symptoms are not uncommon in the early stages of the illness. (d) EEG changes occur early and include diffuse slowing and loss of the dominant alpha rhythm. The pneumoencephalogram may reveal generalized cortical atrophy and/or ventricular dilatation.

Results suggest a "syndrome of low response" among the Ss who presented a greater number of analytical responses, as measured by the tests of conceptual style of Kagan. These data show the coarctated character and poor discrimination of the Ss before perceptual stimuli and an interesting problem noted by this failure in perceptual organization. It has been considered that the analytic-global dimension was the principle of cognitive control. It is expected that such processes explain in part the Ss' inadequacy in social situations and in relation to the "reality principle."

AB  - The widespread disturbance of function in the schizophrenic does not lie at the level of sensory or reflex phenomena, but in perceptual organization and in voluntary behavior, especially where such is demanded by social norms. The schizophrenic is unable to take and maintain a definite set-he withdraws, simplifies, and handles unsuccessfully a complicated situation. He is responsive to environmental stimulation only superficially. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Statistical data from the Rorschach test are presented for 7 manic-depressive depressions, 13 neurotic and reactive depressions, and 14 agitated depressions and depressions with schizophrenic features. Comparisons are made to norms derived from 144 college students. There is a close relationship between limited perceptual organization (closure) and the constricted personality. "Constriction found in socially normal individuals may be regarded as a fundamental characterological deviation while that of the depressives may or may not be typical of their pre-psychotic personalities."

AB  - This 3-part factor analytic study examined whether varying type and degree of pathology alters the structure of intelligence as measured by Wechsler tests, whether the normal aging process will do so, and by comparing pathology groups directly with age-equivalent normals, whether pathology per se alters intellectual structure. 8 groups were used: 4 pathological ones including neurotic, acute schizophrenic, brain damaged (each with N of 100), and chronic schizophrenic Ss (N of 127), and 4 normal groups of different ages including Ss 18-19 (N of 200), 25-34 (N of 300), 60-75 (N of 352). The intercorrelation matrix of Wais and W-B subtests for the pathological Ss was factor analyzed by Thurstone's complete centroid method; centroids were rotated by the oblique Biquartimin technique. 3 through 7 factors were rotated and the 4 factor (Verbal, perceptual organization, memory/freedom for distractibility, quasi-specific digit symbol factors) solution adopted. Chronic schizophrenic Ss showed particular similarity to brain-damaged group instead of acute schizophrenics, and similarity between pathological groups compared with nonage-related normals.

The normal group consistently demonstrated a higher level of perceptual organization and integration than did the psychopathological groups, lending support to the developmental theory of Werner and revealing a consistent pattern of perceptual responses in each group for each sensory modality.

AB  - A device providing for the direct measurement of perceived body size has been developed. 41 Ss (20 nonpatient controls, and 21 psychotic patients) estimated the bodily dimensions of height, width, and depth with the aid of this device. There were no patient-control differences, sex differences, or session differences in the errors of estimate. The descending estimates were greater than the corresponding ascending estimates of all 3 dimensions. The descending estimates were significantly different from the true dimensions of height and depth, while the ascending estimes were not. Overall estimates were significantly different from the measurements of actual height. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The following hypotheses were tested: (a) Schizophrenics (N = 25) will produce less accurate size-judgments than normals (N = 25). (b) Schizophrenic patients who have made poor premorbid sexual and social adjustments will produce less accurate size-judgments than those who have made good adjustments. The results show that, although schizophrenics did not differ from normals in mean size estimates (pictures of thematic content), they did show greater variance. Good and poor "premorbids" differed markedly from each other, the former tending to diminish and the latter to enlarge size. 26 references.

The scorer reliability was 91 per cent. A non-parametric, median test, chi square analysis indicated significant differences between normal and clinical groups for all three TAT scores; PO and PR significantly differentiated all three groups. Length of story was taken into account and the relationships between IQ scores and TAT scores were determined. A prediction measure indicated that PO was the maximally discriminating category and successfully isolated 88 per cent of normals, 72 per cent of neurotics, and 88 per cent of psychotics. This scoring system constitutes a formal aid to content analysis and further validation is necessary." (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study compared the subtest scores on the Wechsler-Bellevue test of adult intelligence of a control sample and 31 patients institutionalized for senile psychoses. As in normal aging the tests involving verbal comprehension show less decline in the senile psychoses than tests requiring perceptual organization of a relatively unfamiliar task. The amount of decline in a subtest with age does not appear to be a criterion of the subtest to differentiate between individuals aging normally and those with senile psychoses.

AB  - A picture test with four scenes and three Gestalt figures was administered to 42 postconvulsive patients. A disturbance in correlation of isolated items and in the integration of the whole picture was noted. Recognition of Gestalt was affected when this disturbance was marked. Similar results are reported for an epileptic patient during a confusional episode. The findings are felt to correspond to some of the features of epileptic disorders of consciousness of petit-mal and fugue states. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Goodenough drawings were obtained from a group of untreated schizophrenics and from schizophrenics recovering from insulin and metrazol treatments. Samples of the drawings secured at successive intervals during recovery from several patients are presented. Characteristics of schizophrenic drawings are: (1) incompleteness and distortion, (2) disproportion between parts of the body, (3) stereotypy, (4) disruptive addition of primitive form elements, (5) perseveration. The drawings in the period of recovery from treatment show a variety of characteristics. There are "decided signs of organic confusion in gestalt perception and representation." When organic confusion subsides, the "schizophrenic integration soon gets the upper hand." Insulin and metrazol therapy attacks not the schizophrenic structures but deeper seated ones, the changes in which may be reflected in the reorganization of the schizophrenic process.

AB  - After a very brief treatment of the botany and chemistry of mescal, Kluver deals with the characteristics of mescal visions, indicates some of the effects of mescal intoxication in other than the visual sense fields, describes the so-called mescal psychosis, and finally suggests problems of a psychological nature for future research. By far the greater part of the essay is taken up by a description of the characteristic visual effects of mescal. Here Kluver draws upon the experimental investigations of others and supplements these by observations derived from his own experience. An attempt is made to work out constant characteristics in the form, movement and color of the visual illusions experienced by different observers. Some remarks are included concerning the possible likeness of peyoteinduced visions and certain of the outstanding features of eidetic imagery.
