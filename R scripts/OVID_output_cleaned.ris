AB  - Background and objectives: A disruption in the co-ordination of bottom-up and top-down processing is thought to underlie anomalous perceptual experiences in psychosis. Visual illusions represent a valuable methodology in exploring this disruption. Here, we examined visual illusions in a group of young people having psychotic-like experiences. We also examined the relationship between illusion susceptibility and appraisal of psychotic-like experiences as well as depression, anxiety and stress levels. Method(s): 25 young people reporting psychotic-like experiences and 53 healthy participants performed an adjustment task that measured susceptibility to a battery of 13 visual illusions. Levels of depression, anxiety and stress were quantified in both groups. The clinical group also completed measures examining frequency, appraisals and emotional responses to psychotic-like experiences. Result(s): A general increase of illusion susceptibility was found in the clinical group compared to the control group. However, when depression, anxiety and stress levels were controlled for, this difference disappeared. Stress turned out to be the best predictor of illusion susceptibility in the clinical group, whereas anomalous experiences, depression and anxiety were unrelated to overall illusion strength. Limitation(s): This study is limited to young participants reporting significant mental health difficulties and psychotic-like experiences. Findings should be replicated in an Ultra High Risk (prodromal) group. Conclusion(s): Increased levels of stress explained the enhanced vulnerability to illusions in the clinical group. This increased susceptibility suggests a perceptual style that relies too heavily on prior expectations at the expense of the true sensory evidence, potentially leading to an altered perceptual experience of the world.Copyright <c2><a9> 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Computational psychiatry: From synapses to sentience
AU  - Friston, Karl
PY  - 2023
AB  - This review considers computational psychiatry from a particular viewpoint: namely, a commitment to explaining psychopathology in terms of pathophysiology. It rests on the notion of a generative model as underwriting (i) sentient processing in the brain, and (ii) the scientific process in psychiatry. The story starts with a view of the brain-from cognitive and computational neuroscience-as an organ of inference and prediction. This offers a formal description of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks; and how certain kinds of dysconnection lead to aberrant belief updating and false inference. The dysconnections in question can be read as a pernicious synaptopathy that fits comfortably with formal notions of how we-or our brains-encode uncertainty or its complement, precision. It then considers how the ensuing process theories are tested empirically, with an emphasis on the computational modelling of neuronal circuits and synaptic gain control that mediates attentional set, active inference, learning and planning. The opportunities afforded by this sort of modelling are considered in light of in silico experiments; namely, computational neuropsychology, computational phenotyping and the promises of a computational nosology for psychiatry. The resulting survey of computational approaches is not scholarly or exhaustive. Rather, its aim is to review a theoretical narrative that is emerging across subdisciplines within psychiatry and empirical scales of investigation. These range from epilepsy research to neurodegenerative disorders; from post-traumatic stress disorder to the management of chronic pain, from schizophrenia to functional medical symptoms.

AB  - Perceptual distortions are core features of psychosis. Weakened contrast surround suppression has been proposed as a neural mechanism underlying atypical perceptual experiences. Although previous work has measured suppression by asking participants to report the perceived contrast of a low-contrast target surrounded by a high-contrast surround, it is possible to modulate perceived contrast solely by manipulating the orientation of a matched-contrast center and surround. Removing the bottom-up segmentation cue of contrast difference and isolating orientation-dependent suppression may clarify the neural processes responsible for atypical surround suppression in psychosis. We examined surround suppression across a spectrum of psychotic psychopathology including people with schizophrenia (PSZ; N = 31) and people with bipolar disorder (PBD; N = 29), first-degree biological relatives of these patient groups (PBDrel, PSZrel; N = 28, N = 21, respectively), and healthy controls (N = 29). PSZ exhibited reduced surround suppression across orientations; although group differences were minimal at the condition that produced the strongest suppression. PBD and PSZrel exhibited intermediate suppression, whereas PBDrel performed most similarly to controls. Intriguingly, group differences in orientation-dependent surround suppression magnitude were moderated by visual acuity. A simulation in which visual acuity and/or focal attention interact with untuned gain control reproduces the observed pattern of results, including the lack of group differences when orientation of center and surround are the same. Our findings further elucidate perceptual mechanisms of impaired center-surround processing in psychosis and provide insights into the effects of visual acuity on orientation-dependent suppression in PSZ.

AB  - The findings on the association of schizotypal traits with the perception of visual illusions are scarce and inconsistent and have not taken into consideration potential effects of childhood traumatic experiences, a risk factor for schizophrenia-spectrum conditions. Thus, the present study addressed the question of potential moderating effects of early traumatic experiences on the association between different aspects of schizotypal traits with the perception of the Muller-Lyer and Navon's Hierarchical Letters (NHL) illusions. The study revealed that (a) increased suspiciousness was associated with increased liability to the Muller-Lyer illusion, when the exposure to traumatic events was high, whereas the opposite pattern was true when the exposure to traumatic events was low; (b) negative schizotypy was associated with more accurate global perception, and high disorganized schizotypy was associated with superior accuracy when target letters were present during the NHL illusion, when early traumatic experiences were at lower levels; and (c) high negative, disorganized, and total schizotypy were associated with lower accuracy when target letters were present in the NHL paradigm, when early traumatic experiences were at higher levels. The findings of the study suggest that early traumatic events differentially moderate the relationship between various aspects of schizotypal traits and visual perceptual processing.

AB  - Antagonistic interactions between center and surround receptive field (RF) components lie at the heart of the computations performed in the visual system. Circularly symmetric center-surround RFs are thought to enhance responses to spatial contrasts (i.e., edges), but how visual edges affect motion processing is unclear. Here, we addressed this question in retinal bipolar cells, the first visual neuron with classic center-surround interactions. We found that bipolar glutamate release emphasizes objects that emerge in the RF; their responses to continuous motion are smaller, slower, and cannot be predicted by signals elicited by stationary stimuli. In our hands, the alteration in signal dynamics induced by novel objects was more pronounced than edge enhancement and could be explained by priming of RF surround during continuous motion. These findings echo the salience of human visual perception and demonstrate an unappreciated capacity of the center-surround architecture to facilitate novel object detection and dynamic signal representation.

AB  - Here we investigate how the extent of spatial attention affects center-surround interaction in visual motion processing. To do so, we measured motion direction discrimination thresholds in humans using drifting gratings and two attention conditions. Participants were instructed to limit their attention to the central part of the stimulus under the narrow attention condition, and to both central and surround parts under the wide attention condition. We found stronger surround suppression under the wide attention condition. The magnitude of the attention effect increased with the size of the surround when the stimulus had low contrast, but did not change when it had high contrast. Results also showed that attention had a weaker effect when the center and surround gratings drifted in opposite directions. Next, to establish a link between the behavioral results and the neuronal response characteristics, we performed computer simulations using the divisive normalization model. Our simulations showed that using smaller versus larger multiplicative attentional gain and parameters derived from the medial temporal (MT) area of the cortex, the model can successfully predict the observed behavioral results. These findings reveal the critical role of spatial attention on surround suppression and establish a link between neuronal activity and behavior. Further, these results also suggest that the reduced surround suppression found in certain clinical disorders (e.g., schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder) may be caused by abnormal attention mechanisms.

AB  - The ability to imitate is considered impaired in schizophrenia patients. This assumption, however, is based on heterogeneous studies mostly targeting voluntary imitation, e.g., pantomime. Studies on automatic imitation, however, and on underlying mechanisms of top-down inhibition of automatic imitation and contextual modulation in schizophrenia are highly limited. We employed two sensorimotor paradigms to examine imitation-inhibition and action context mapping in 37 schizophrenia patients and 36 matched controls. In the first experiment, participants performed finger lifts while observing a hand executing compatible or incompatible finger lifts from the third-person perspective. The compatibility or incompatibility of these finger lifts affected participants' reaction times (RTs). The comparison of between-condition RT differences shows a larger movement compatibility effect in schizophrenia than in controls. The second experiment involved finger lifts while watching a still hand, from the first-person perspective, with constrained fingers that either corresponded or did not correspond to the participants' response fingers. Here, schizophrenia patients showed a diminished RT slowing in corresponding constraint trials. While the former results provide evidence for an impaired control of imitation in patients with schizophrenia, the latter results indicate a reduced encoding of action context. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence for deficits of top-down control of imitation and motor context processing in the same sample of schizophrenia patients.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate how participating in the early recognition method treatment strategy affect illness insight and management, in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in community mental healthcare., BACKGROUND: The current practice in mental healthcare focus on shared decision-making and self-managing capacity, but poor insight is a predictor of poor adherence and dropout. Engagement in illness management and recovery predict the treatment response., DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews with a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach., METHODS: We conducted 36 semi-structured interviews with 26 patients. The interviews were conducted before and after participating in the intervention using the early recognition method strategy. The analysis was based on Ricoeur's theory of interpretation: Naive reading, structural analysis, interpretation and discussion. The COREQ checklist was used as reporting guideline., RESULTS: The experience of participating in treatment as usual and early recognition method revealed two main themes. The first theme 'patient care' describes how dialogue and collaboration increase awareness of the illness and how to gain control. The second theme 'insight and experience' describes how illness affects personality and self-image, and how insight entails control and self-confidence., CONCLUSION: Managing life with severe mental illness is complex and challenging. However, the experience of guidance, support and collaboration between patient and nurse are essential to improve these circumstances., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A systematic approach to the patient' symptoms, as in the early recognition method strategy, enhances knowledge of the individual patient' symptoms, both for nurse and patient. A knowledge that is significant for meeting individual treatment needs. Therefore, applying this strategy is likely to enhance collaboration and improve treatment outcome.

AB  - Objectives: Minor hallucinations (MH) are psychotic symptoms that can occur anywhere between prodromal to early Parkinson's disease and after onset of motor problems. MH include visual illusions, presence hallucinations, and passage hallucinations. Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a harbinger of neurodegenerative diseases. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the clinical characteristics of isolated RBD with MH and the risk of phenoconversion. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 36 patients with isolated RBD (four females; median age, 75.0 years). We defined cases reporting at least one minor hallucination as RBD with MH. Demographic data and cognitive function were compared between patients with and without MH, and Cox proportional hazards models estimated the risk of phenoconversion. Result(s): We included 10 (27.8%) patients with MH and 26 (72.2%) without MH. Patients with MH were older, had less dopamine transporter accumulation, more severe autonomic dysfunction, more depressive symptoms, and lower verbal fluency and symbol coding test scores than patients without MH. After follow-up (median, 2.50 years), 13.9% (5/36) of all patients developed phenoconversion (Parkinson's disease, two patients; dementia with Lewy bodies, three patients). The rate of phenoconversion was significantly higher in patients with MH (40.0% vs. 3.8%, p =.005). The Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration revealed that MH was a significant risk factor for phenoconversion (hazard ratio, 14.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-160.5). Conclusion(s): Minor hallucinations may be utilized as early clinical markers for prodromal estimation of neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Visual illusions (VI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are generally considered as an early feature of the psychosis spectrum leading to fully formed visual hallucinations (VH), although this sequential relationship has not been clearly demonstrated. Objective(s): We aimed to determine whether there are any overlapping, potentially graded patterns of structural and functional connectivity abnormalities in PD with VI and with VH. Such a finding would argue for a continuum between these entities, whereas distinct imaging features would suggest different neural underpinnings for the phenomena. Method(s): In this case control study, we compared structural and resting state functional MRI brain patterns of PD patients with VH (PD-H, n = 20), with VI (PD-I, n = 19), and without VH or VI (PD-C, n = 23). Result(s): 1) PD-H had hypo-connectivity between the ILO and anterior cingulate precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-I; 2) In contrast, PD-I had hyper-connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and the postcentral gyrus compared to PD-C and PD-H. Moreover, PD-I had higher levels of functional connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and fronto-temporal regions compared to PD-H, together with divergent patterns toward the cingulate. 3) Both PD-I and PD-H had functional hypo-connectivity between the lingual gyrus and the parahippocampal region vs. PD-C, and no significant grey matter volume differences was observed between PD-I and PD-H. Conclusion(s): Distinct patterns of functional connectivity characterized VI and VH in PD, suggesting that these two perceptual experiences, while probably linked and driven by at least some similar mechanisms, could reflect differing neural dysfunction.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - Visual illusions are fascinating phenomena that have been used and studied by artists and scientists for centuries, leading to important discoveries about the neurocognitive underpinnings of perception, consciousness, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Surprisingly, despite their historical and theoretical importance as psychological stimuli, there is no dedicated software, nor consistent approach, to generate illusions in a systematic fashion. Instead, scientists have to craft them by hand in an idiosyncratic fashion, or use pre-made images not tailored for the specific needs of their studies. This, in turn, hinders the reproducibility of illusion-based research, narrowing possibilities for scientific breakthroughs and their applications. With the aim of addressing this gap, Pyllusion is a Python-based open-source software (freely available at https://github.com/RealityBending/Pyllusion), that offers a framework to manipulate and generate illusions in a systematic way, compatible with different output formats such as image files (.png, .jpg, .tiff, etc.) or experimental software (such as PsychoPy).

TI  - N-methyl D-aspartate receptor hypofunction reduces visual contextual integration
AU  - Schielke, Alexander
AU  - Krekelberg, Bart
PY  - 2021
AB  - Visual cognition is finely tuned to the elements in a scene but also relies on contextual integration to improve visual detection and discrimination. This integration is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. Studying impairments in contextual integration may lead to biomarkers of schizophrenia, tools to monitor disease progression, and, in animal models, insight into the underlying neural deficits. We developed a nonhuman primate model to test the hypothesis that hypofunction of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) impairs contextual integration. Two male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were trained to indicate which of two patterns on the screen had the highest contrast. One of these patterns appeared in isolation, and the other was surrounded by a high-contrast pattern. In humans, this high-contrast context is known to lead to an underestimation of contrast. This so-called Chubb illusion is thought to result from surround suppression, a key contextual integration mechanism. To test the involvement of NMDAR in this process, we compared animals' perceptual bias with and without intramuscular injections of a subanesthetic dose of the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. In the absence of ketamine, the animals reported a Chubb illusion - matching reports in healthy humans. Hence, monkeys - just like humans - perform visual contextual integration. This reaffirms the importance of nonhuman primates to help understand visual cognition. Injection of ketamine significantly reduced the strength of the illusion and thus impaired contextual integration. This supports the hypothesis that NMDAR hypofunction plays a causal role in specific behavioral impairments observed in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Psychotic symptoms are an important and increasingly recognized aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They have been shown to contribute to faster disease progression in clinic-based, demographically homogenous samples with high educational attainment. Objective:We studied the association between baseline psychotic symptoms and disease progression among individuals with incident AD or 'at risk' of developing AD, from a demographically heterogenous, community-based cohort with minimal educational attainment. Methods: 212 participants received the Columbia University Scale of Psychopathology in Alzheimer's Disease scale. Participants had psychotic symptoms with any of: visual illusions, delusions, hallucinations, or agitation/aggression. Disease progression was measured yearly and defined by meeting cognitive (<=10 on the Folstein MMSE) or functional endpoints (>=10 on the Blessed Dementia Rating Scale or >=4 on the Dependence Scale). Results: The mean age was 85 years old. The cohort was 78.3% female, 75.9% Hispanic, and had a mean 6.96 years of education. Within the follow-up period (mean: 3.69 years), 24 met the cognitive endpoint, 59 met the functional endpoint, and 132 met the cutoff for dependence. The presence of at least one psychotic symptom was initially associated with an increased risk of reaching the functional endpoint (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.67-5.86, p < 0.001) and the endpoint of dependence (HR = 1.498, 95% CI 1.05-2.13, p = 0.03). However, these associations were attenuated and non-significant when adjusted for baseline functional status. Psychotic symptoms were not associated with the cognitive endpoint. Conclusion: Psychotic symptoms may predict functional decline in patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity and with lower educational attainment.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that processing of visual contrast information could be altered in major depressive disorder. To clarify the changes at different levels of the visual hierarchy, we behaviourally measured contrast perception in 2 centre-surround conditions, assessing retinal and cortical processing. Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study, our sample consisted of controls (n = 29; 21 female) and patients with unipolar depression, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder who had baseline major depressive episodes (n = 111; 74 female). In a brightness induction test that assessed retinal processing, participants compared the perceived luminance of uniform patches (presented on a computer screen) as the luminance of the backgrounds was varied. In a contrast suppression test that assessed cortical processing, participants compared the perceived contrast of gratings, which were presented with collinearly or orthogonally oriented backgrounds. Results: Brightness induction was similar for patients with major depressive episodes and controls (p = 0.60, d = 0.115, Bayes factor = 3.9), but contrast suppression was significantly lower for patients than for controls (p < 0.006, d = 0.663, Bayes factor = 35.2). We observed no statistically significant associations between contrast suppression and age, sex, or medication or diagnostic subgroup. At follow-up (n = 74), we observed some normalization of contrast perception. Limitations: We assessed contrast perception using behavioural tests instead of electrophysiology. Conclusion: The reduced contrast suppression we observed may have been caused by decreased retinal feedforward or cortical feedback signals. Because we observed intact brightness induction, our results suggest normal retinal but altered cortical processing of visual contrast during a major depressive episode. This alteration is likely to be present in multiple types of depression and to partially normalize upon remission. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reductions of the auditory N100 are present in schizophrenia, even at the first episode (FESz). Because most studies examine auditory N100 on active target detection oddball tasks, it remains unclear if the abnormality in FESz results from sensory deficits or impaired enhancement of N100 by selective attention, or both. N100 was recorded from 21 FESz and 22 matched healthy controls (HC) on a single-tone task and a two-tone oddball task. Overall, N100 was smaller in FESz (p = .036). Attention enhanced N100 amplitude (p < .001), but this differed between groups, with FESz impaired in N100 modulation (group x attention, p = .012). The oddball task showed greater N100 enhancement than the single-tone task (p < .001) in both groups. Group differences in N100 enhancement in the oddball task were large (Cohen's d = 0.85). Exploratory correlations showed that better N100 enhancement on the oddball task in FESz was associated with better MATRICS Overall Composite scores (cognitive tasks highly sensitive to psychosis), lower PANNS Negative factor and SANS scores, and better interpersonal (social) and role functioning in the last year. N100 during ignore conditions showed no significant difference between groups, albeit smaller in FESz, with small to medium effect sizes. Although sensory deficits in N100 are likely present, they are compounded by a failure to enhance N100 with attention. The failure of N100 enhancement by attentional gain control in FESz suggests functional dysconnection between cognitive control areas and the sensory cortex. N100 amplitude on active attention tasks may be a useful outcome biomarker for targeted enhancement of the cognitive control system. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Recent findings on neurofeedback training for auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia
AU  - Hirano, Yoji

PY  - 2021
AB  - Purpose of review: To provide recent evidence on real-time neurofeedback (NFB) training for auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in schizophrenia patients. Recent findings: NFB is a promising technique that allows patients to gain control over their AVH by modulating their own speech-related/language-related networks including superior temporal gyrus (STG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using fMRI, fNIRS and EEG/MEG. A recent limited number of studies showed that while an EEG-based NFB study failed to regulate auditory-evoked potentials and reduce AVH, downregulation of STG hyperactivity and upregulation of ACC activity with fMRI-based NFB appear to alleviate treatment-resistant AVH in schizophrenia patients. A deeper understanding of AVH and development of more effective methodologies are still needed. Summary: Despite recent innovations in antipsychotics, many schizophrenia patients continue to suffer from treatment-resistant AVH and social dysfunctions. Recent studies suggested that real-time NFB shows promise in enabling patients to gain control over AVH by regulating their own speech-related/language-related networks. Although fMRI-NFB is suitable for regulating localized activity, EEG/MEG-NFB are ideal for regulating the ever-changing AVH. Although there are still many challenges including logistic complexity and burden on patients, we hope that such innovative real-time NFB trainings will help patients to alleviate severe symptoms and improve social functioning.

AB  - Objectives: Minor hallucinations (MHs), including sense of presence, passage hallucinations, and visual illusions, have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the prevalence and associated risk factors for MHs according to appearance time. Method(s): Data on the clinical characteristics and the appearance time of MHs for 100 PD patients were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed. MHs were classified into two groups according to the time when MHs appeared: MHs appearing while awake during the daytime (dMHs) and MHs appearing at arousal from sleep during the night or early morning (aMHs). Result(s): Thirty-eight patients (38%) experienced MHs. dMHs and aMHs were present in 21 (21%) and 28 patients (28%), respectively. Compared to patients without MHs, patients with dMHs had more severe motor symptoms, longer disease duration, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), and higher rates of cognitive impairment and visual hallucinations during the daytime, whereas patients with aMHs had a higher rate of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), longer disease duration, higher LEDD, and higher dopamine agonist dosage. Logistic regression analysis showed that cognitive impairment was significantly associated with dMHs (odds ratio (OR) 7.292, p =.001), and that RBD (OR 8.306, p <.001) and LEDD (OR 1.002, p =.049) were significantly associated with aMHs. Conclusion(s): Patients with MHs have different clinical characteristics according to the time when MHs appear. These findings have important clinical and prognostic implications and suggest appropriate therapeutic options for psychotic symptoms.Copyright <c2><a9> 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Accurate perception of visual contours is essential for seeing and differentiating objects in the environment. Both the ability to detect visual contours and the influence of perceptual context created by surrounding stimuli are diminished in people with schizophrenia (SCZ). The central aim of the present study was to better understand the biological underpinnings of impaired contour integration and weakened effects of perceptual context. Additionally, we sought to determine whether visual perceptual abnormalities reflect genetic factors in SCZ and are present in other severe mental disorders. Methods: We examined behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs) collected during the perception of simple linear contours embedded in similar background stimuli in 27 patients with SCZ, 23 patients with bipolar disorder (BP), 23 first-degree relatives of SCZ, and 37 controls. Results: SCZ exhibited impaired visual contour detection while BP exhibited intermediate performance. The orientation of neighboring stimuli (i.e. flankers) relative to the contour modulated perception across all groups, but SCZ exhibited weakened suppression by the perceptual context created by flankers. Late visual (occipital P2) and cognitive (centroparietal P3) neural responses showed group differences and flanker orientation effects, unlike earlier ERPs (occipital P1 and N1). Moreover, behavioral effects of flanker context on contour perception were correlated with modulation in P2 & P3 amplitudes. Conclusion: In addition to replicating and extending findings of abnormal contour integration and visual context modulation in SCZ, we provide novel evidence that the abnormal use of perceptual context is associated with higher-order sensory and cognitive processes.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder associated with cognitive dysfunction and changes in primary sensory processing. This article aims to explore the current insights into the relationship between schizophrenia and different visual disturbances. Method(s): To provide a literature review of visual impairments in schizophrenia, we performed a PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus search to identify all articles in English on the topic up to the end of 2018. Result(s): Multiple retinal functional and structural abnormalities are found in patients with schizophrenia. Wider retinal venules suggest chronically insufficient brain supply of oxygen and this could contribute to the occurrence of psychotic symptoms. Optical coherence tomography studies showed that retinal nerve fiber layer, macular thickness, and macular volume were significantly lowered in the chronic phase of schizophrenia. Results from electroretinogram recordings have demonstrated different declinations such as abnormalities of a - wave activity in the photoreceptors or b - wave activity in the bipolar and Muller cells. Abnormalities in eye movements, such as a notable decrease in saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements, are one of the most reliable and reproducible impairments associated with schizophrenia. Disrupted visual processing of the magnocellular pathway may result in a decrease of contrast sensitivity, sensory processing, orientation discrimination, visual integration, trajectory and spatial localization, backward masking and motion tracking. Visual perceptual abnormalities occur in more than 60% of schizophrenic patients and these are visual hallucinations, perceptual distortion of colors, shapes and light intensity, decrease in contour integration and surround suppression. Other, frequently present eye disorders include impaired visual acuity, strabismus and nystagmus. Conclusion(s): Visual impairments are one of the most important features of schizophrenia, which could help in defining the disease state and assigning appropriate treatment.Copyright <c2><a9> Medicinska naklada - Zagreb, Croatia

PY  - 2020
AB  - The limited dynamic range of regular screens restricts the display of high dynamic range (HDR) images. Inspired by retinal processing mechanisms, we propose a tone mapping method to address this problem. In the retina, horizontal cells (HCs) adaptively adjust their receptive field (RF) size based on the local stimuli to regulate the visual signals absorbed by photoreceptors. Using this adaptive mechanism, the proposed method compresses the dynamic range locally in different regions, and has the capability of avoiding halo artifacts around the edges of high luminance contrast. Moreover, the proposed method introduces the center-surround antagonistic RF structure of bipolar cells (BCs) to enhance the local contrast and details. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method performs robustly well on a wide variety of images, providing competitive results against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual inspection, objective metrics and observer scores.

AB  - Hallucinations have been found to be associated with various types of source memory failure in both schizophrenia patients and hallucination-prone healthy individuals. We investigated the associations of clinical and non-clinical hallucinations with source memory errors in a visual memory task that involved the remembering of picture presentation context. 59 schizophrenia patients and 61 healthy individuals took part in the study. Pictures were presented either at different locations or in association with different visual stimuli. The participants were required afterwards to recognize the target pictures among distractors, and then to remember their spatial location or the visual stimulus that was associated with them. Liberal response bias in picture recognition was associated with hallucination proneness and auditory-verbal hallucinations in subsamples of participants with significant non-clinical or clinical hallucinations. After controlling for overall memory performance, failure to remember the spatial location of the pictures was associated with visual hallucinations in male patients; failure to remember the associated visual stimulus was related to auditory-verbal hallucinations in female patients and to hallucination proneness in healthy women. The findings suggest that both clinical and non-clinical hallucinations are associated with loss of contextual information relative to the acquisition of events.

AB  - The predictive coding account of psychosis postulates the abnormal formation of prior beliefs in schizophrenia, resulting in psychotic symptoms. One domain in which priors play a crucial role is visual perception. For instance, our perception of brightness, line length, and motion direction are not merely based on a veridical extraction of sensory input but are also determined by expectation (or prior) of the stimulus. Formation of such priors is thought to be governed by the statistical regularities within natural scenes. Recently, the use of such priors has been attributed to a specific set of well-documented visual illusions, supporting the idea that perception is biased toward what is statistically more probable within the environment. The Predictive Coding account of psychosis proposes that patients form abnormal representations of statistical regularities in natural scenes, leading to altered perceptual experiences. Here we use classical vision experiments involving a specific set of visual illusions to directly test this hypothesis. We find that perceptual judgments for both patients and control participants are biased in accordance with reported probability distributions of natural scenes. Thus, despite there being a suggested link between visual abnormalities and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia, our results provide no support for the notion that altered formation of priors is a general feature of the disorder. These data call for a refinement in the predictions of quantitative models of psychosis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The visual system is recognized as an important site of pathology and dysfunction in schizophrenia. In this study, we evaluated different visual perceptual functions in patients with psychotic disorders using a potentially clinically applicable task battery and assessed their relationship with symptom severity in patients, and with schizotypal features in healthy participants. Methods: Five different areas of visual functioning were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (n = 28) and healthy control subjects (n = 31) using a battery that included visuospatial working memory (VSWM), velocity discrimination (VD), contour integration, visual context processing, and backward masking tasks. Results: The patient group demonstrated significantly lower performance in VD, contour integration, and VSWM tasks. Performance did not differ between the two groups on the visual context processing task and did not differ across levels of interstimulus intervals in the backward masking task. Performances on VSWM, VD, and contour integration tasks were correlated with negative symptom severity but not with other symptom dimensions in the patient group. VSWM and VD performances were also correlated with negative sychizotypal features in healthy controls. Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate significant abnormalities in multiple visual processing tasks in patients with psychotic disorders, adding to the literature implicating visual abnormalities in these conditions. Furthermore, our results show that visual processing impairments are associated with the negative symptom dimension in patients as well as healthy individuals.

AB  - There seems to be no common factor for visual perception, i.e., performance in visual tasks correlates only weakly with each other. Similar results were found with visual illusions. One may expect common visual factors for individuals suffering from pathologies that alter brain functioning, such as schizophrenia. For example, patients who are more severely affected by the disease, e.g., stronger positive symptoms, may show increased illusion magnitudes. Here, in the first experiment, we used a battery of seven visual illusions and a mental imagery questionnaire. Illusion magnitudes for the seven illusions did not differ significantly between the patients and controls. In addition, correlations between the different illusions and mental imagery were low. In the second experiment, we tested 59 patients (mostly outpatients) with ten visual illusions. As for the first experiment, patients and controls showed similar susceptibility to all but one visual illusion. Moreover, there were no significant correlations between different illusions, symptoms, or medication type. Thus, it seems that perception of visual illusions is mostly intact in schizophrenia.

AB  - Introduction: "Body swapping" illusions have been used to explore factors contributing to the experience of "owning" an artificial body. Preliminary research indicated that those people diagnosed with schizophrenia experience more vivid illusions of this kind than do "normal" individuals. Objectives: Here, we explored whether participants who rated themselves "high" on the cognitive-perceptual factor of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) experienced a more compelling sense of immersion in a variation of the body swapping illusion: The Barbie Doll Illusion. We also hypothesised that these individuals would experience a change in size perception when immersed in the illusion. Method: Forty-four participants wore a pair of Head-Mounted Display goggles connected to a video-camera, and thus a doll's body replaced their own body in their visual field. In two conditions, touch was either applied synchronously or asynchronously to the doll's and each participant's leg. After each condition, participants filled out a questionnaire relating to their experience in the illusion. When both conditions were completed, they filled out the SPQ. Results: Our first hypothesis was confirmed, which suggested that people with higher cognitive-perceptual SPQ scores do indeed experience a more compelling Barbie Doll Illusion; however, our second hypothesis was not supported. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that proneness to the positive and interpersonal factors of schizotypy in a normal population is sufficient to produce a compelling sense of swapping bodies.

AB  - Background: Hallucinations may have a broad spectrum and include so-called minor hallucinations (MHs). MHs include passage hallucinations (PHs), visual illusions, and presence hallucinations (PrHs). Objective(s): To determine the prevalence and characteristics of MHs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and to describe their potential relationship with cognition, behavioral symptoms, and use of psychoactive drugs. Method(s): We have recruited prospectively and consecutively 268 subjects (90 AD mild-moderate drug-naive patients, 78 aMCI, and 100 controls). All patients responded to a semi-structured questionnaire in order to rate psychotic phenomena. Clinical, neuropsychological, and demographic data of patients with and without MH were compared with those of age, sex, and education-matched controls. Result(s): The prevalence of MHs was 21.1% (19) in AD, 12.8% (10) in aMCI, and 3% (3) in controls (p < 0.01). The most frequent MH was PrH (9.3%), followed by PH (4.9%) and illusion (0.7%). Eight (27.8%) patients had more than one MH. After adjusting for age and gender, there was a negative correlation between the presence of MHs and MMSE score (r = -0.261; p < 0.01) and a positive correlation between MHs and Neuropsychiatric Inventory score (r = 0.237; p < 0.01). We did not observe a significant relationship between presence of MHs and the consumption of psychoactive drugs (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): We have shown that the presence of MHs in patients with newly diagnosed, untreated AD and aMCI is more than controls. MHs were correlated with other behavioral symptoms and a worse cognitive performance. We suggest the specific interrogation for MHs as a clinical feature for this population.Copyright <c2><a9> 2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hallucinations, a cardinal feature of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, are known to depend on excessive striatal dopamine. However, an underlying cognitive mechanism linking dopamine dysregulation and the experience of hallucinatory percepts remains elusive. Bayesian models explain perception as an optimal combination of prior expectations and new sensory evidence, where perceptual distortions such as illusions and hallucinations may occur if prior expectations are afforded excessive weight. Such excessive weight of prior expectations, in turn, could stem from a gain-control process controlled by neuromodulators such as dopamine. To test for such a dopamine-dependent gain-control mechanism of hallucinations, we studied unmedicated patients with schizophrenia with varying degrees of hallucination severity and healthy individuals using molecular imaging with a pharmacological manipulation of dopamine, structural imaging, and a novel task designed to measure illusory changes in the perceived duration of auditory stimuli under different levels of uncertainty. Hallucinations correlated with a perceptual bias, reflecting disproportional gain on expectations under uncertainty. This bias could be pharmacologically induced by amphetamine, strongly correlated with striatal dopamine release, and related to cortical volume of the dorsal anterior cingulate, a brain region involved in tracking environmental uncertainty. These findings outline a novel dopamine-dependent mechanism for perceptual modulation in physiological conditions and further suggest that this mechanism may confer vulnerability to hallucinations in hyper-dopaminergic states underlying psychosis.

AB  - Introduction: Considering that psychosis in Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with worse outcomes, including dementia, we aimed to study the characteristics, correlates, and assessment of PD psychosis in those without dementia. Methods: 101 PD subjects without dementia (Montreal Cognitive Assessment >= 21/30) were recruited to participate in a study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD. This study included a baseline standard neurological exam and common PD symptom assessments. Using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and separate assessment of visual illusions and sense of presence, NINDS-NIMH criteria for PD psychosis were applied. Results: Of the 33 (32.7%) PD subjects who met diagnostic criteria for psychosis in PD, visual illusions were most common (72.7%), followed by visual hallucinations (39.4%). Adjusted for presence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (p = 0.097), use of dopamine agonists (OR = 3.7, p = 0.012) and greater autonomic symptom burden (OR = 1.1 (per 1-unit change in score on SCOPA-AUT), p = 0.012) were associated with greater risk of psychosis. Use of dopamine agonists (OR = 5.0, p = 0.007), higher MDS-UPDRS Part II score (OR = 1.1, p = 0.010), and presence of RBD (OR = 4.8, p = 0.012) were independent predictors of visual hallucinations and visual illusions. MDS-UPDRS item 1.2 score >= 1 had highly correlated with the SAPS score (r = 0.65, p < 0.0001), but was 42% sensitive and 96% specific for identifying psychosis. Conclusion: This study confirms the association between dopamine agonists and psychosis in PD patients without dementia. The association of RBD, autonomic symptoms, and MDS-UPDRS Part II scores with psychosis underscore its link to brainstem dysfunction and greater PD motor symptom severity.

AB  - Objective: To describe a rare case of a patient who developed psychotic symptoms after a right stroke that disappeared with antipsychotic treatment, but appears to need low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy. Case description: A 65-year-old man presented at the psychiatric emergency service with a history of persistent delusional jealousy, visual illusions and agitation with onset about 1 month after a right posterior cerebral artery ischemic stroke. These symptoms only disappeared with therapeutic dosages of an antipsychotic drug (3 mg/day of risperidone). At 2-year follow-up, he no longer had delusional activity and the antipsychotic treatment was gradually discontinued over the following year. However, 1 week after full cessation, the patient once more became agitated and suspicious and was put back on risperidone at 0.25 mg/day, resulting in rapid clinical remission. One year after the return to low-dose risperidone, the patient's psychopathology is still under control and he is free from psychotic symptoms. Comments: Psychosis is a relatively rare complication after stroke. To our knowledge, no cases of post-stroke psychosis that apparently require continuous low-dose antipsychotic treatment have been reported to date. Our case suggests that low-dose maintenance antipsychotic therapy may be needed for certain patients with post-stroke psychosis, especially for those with risk factors and non-acute onset.

Descricao de caso: Um homem de 65 anos apresentou-se no servico de urgencia psiquiatrica por um quadro persistente de delirio de ciumes, ilusoes visuais e agitacao com inicio cerca de 1 mes apos AVC isquemico no nivel da arteria cerebral posterior direita. Esses sintomas so desapareceram com doses terapeuticas de antipsicotico (risperidona 3 mg/dia). Apos 2 anos de seguimento, o paciente nao mais apresentava atividade delirante, e o tratamento antipsicotico foi progressivamente descontinuado durante o ano seguinte. No entanto, 1 semana apos a suspensao total, o paciente comecou a ficar agitado e desconfiado, tendo-se reiniciado a risperidona 0,25 mg/dia, com rapida remissao clinica. O paciente esta medicado com esta baixa dose de antipsicotico ha um ano, permanecendo psicopatologicamente compensado e sem sintomas psicoticos. Comentarios: A psicose e uma complicacao relativamente rara apos AVC. Segundo nosso conhecimento, nao ha casos descritos ate ao momento de psicose apos AVC que, aparentemente, requerem uma dose baixa continua de antipsicotico. Nosso caso sugere que uma terapeutica de manutencao com antipsicotico em baixa dosagem pode ser necessaria para determinados pacientes com psicose apos AVC, especialmente para aqueles com fatores de risco e inicio nao agudo dos sintomas.

AB  - Objective: Patients with Lewy body disease develop a variety of psychotic and misperception symptoms, including visual hallucinations and delusions, as well as 'minor hallucinations', that is, a sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions. Although these symptoms have been suggested to have common underlying mechanisms, the commonalities and differences among them have not been systematically investigated at the neural level. Methods: Sixty-seven patients with Parkinson's disease underwent neuropsychological and behavioural assessments, volumetric MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A factor analysis was performed to discover correlations among psychotic and misperception symptoms, other behavioural symptoms and neuropsychological performances. Partial least-squares correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between these symptoms and the joint features of MRI and FDG-PET. Results: A sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions constituted a single behavioural factor (minor hallucinations/illusions). Visual hallucinations formed another behavioural factor along with delusions, depression and fluctuating cognition (psychosis/dysphoria). Three distinct brain-behaviour correlation patterns were identified: (1) posterior cortical atrophy/hypometabolism associated with minor hallucinations/illusions and visuospatial impairment; (2) upper brainstem and thalamic atrophy/hypometabolism associated with psychosis/dysphoria and (3) frontal cortical atrophy/hypometabolism associated with non-visual cognition. No significant differences in neuroimaging findings were identified between patients who had minor hallucinations/illusions alone and patients who also had visual hallucinations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that combined damage to the upper brainstem/thalamus and the posterior neocortex underlies both minor hallucinations/illusions and visual hallucinations and that the former pathology is more associated with visual hallucinations/ frank psychosis and the latter is more associated with minor hallucinations/illusions.

AB  - The "dysconnection hypothesis" of psychosis suggests that a disruption of functional integration underlies cognitive deficits and clinical symptoms. Impairments in the P300 potential are well documented in psychosis. Intrinsic (self-)connectivity in a frontoparietal cortical hierarchy during a P300 experiment was investigated. Dynamic Causal Modeling was used to estimate how evoked activity results from the dynamics of coupled neural populations and how neural coupling changes with the experimental factors. Twenty-four patients with psychotic disorder, twenty-four unaffected relatives, and twenty-five controls underwent EEG recordings during an auditory oddball paradigm. Sixteen frontoparietal network models (including primary auditory, superior parietal, and superior frontal sources) were analyzed and an optimal model of neural coupling, explaining diagnosis and genetic risk effects, as well as their interactions with task condition were identified. The winning model included changes in connectivity at all three hierarchical levels. Patients showed decreased self-inhibition-that is, increased cortical excitability-in left superior frontal gyrus across task conditions, compared with unaffected participants. Relatives had similar increases in excitability in left superior frontal and right superior parietal sources, and a reversal of the normal synaptic gain changes in response to targets relative to standard tones. It was confirmed that both subjects with psychotic disorder and their relatives show a context-independent loss of synaptic gain control at the highest hierarchy levels. The relatives also showed abnormal gain modulation responses to task-relevant stimuli. These may be caused by NMDA-receptor and/or GABAergic pathologies that change the excitability of superficial pyramidal cells and may be a potential biological marker for psychosis.

AB  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 38(13) of The Journal of Neuroscience (see record 2018-15923-023). In the original article, there is an error in Figure 2, where the labels at the bottom of the two columns have been incorrectly switched. The correct labels are shown in the figure presented in the erratum and corrected on the online PDF version.] People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal visual perception on a range of visual tasks, which have been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. However, differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons, which might explain these visual anomalies, have yet to be reported in vivo. Here, we probed the neural basis of these deficits using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a difference-of-Gaussian model to capture the center-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2, and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Specific abnormalities of vision in schizophrenia have been observed to affect high-level and some low-level integration mechanisms, suggesting that people with schizophrenia may experience anomalies across different stages in the visual system affecting either early or late processing or both. Here, we review the research into visual illusion perception in schizophrenia and the issues which previous research has faced. One general finding that emerged from the literature is that those with schizophrenia are mostly immune to the effects of high-level illusory displays, but this effect is not consistent across all low-level illusions. The present review suggests that this resistance is due to the weakening of top-down perceptual mechanisms and may be relevant to the understanding of symptoms of visual distortion rather than hallucinations as previously thought.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was an assessment of the phenomenon of depth perception in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects., METHODS: We conducted a comparison erroneous assessment of the concave side of the mask as convex, using the popular website presenting rotating Charlie Chaplin's mask. The study was performed in patients hospitalized at the Stanislaw Kryzan Psychiatric Hospital in Starogard Gdanski diagnosed with paranoid and undifferentiated schizophrenia based on ICD-10 criteria and control group matched for age and education; each group included 58 subjects., RESULTS: The correct perception of depth in the hollow mask illusion regards approx. 30% of patients with paranoid and undifferentiated schizophrenia during exacerbation and it is three times higher in this group than in the general population. Except the number of relapses and hospitalization in anamnesis, it shows no correlation with another clinical and demographic data such as: the age of onset, the duration of illness, and results on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)., CONCLUSIONS: The correct perception of the hollow mask may be potentially one of the subsequent premises for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in doubtful cases. The simplicity and general availability is also an argument for conducting the test.

AB  - Objective: Psychotic phenomena can occur in non-clinical subjects. The goals of this study were to assess the prevalence of delusions, hallucinations and minor 'psychotic' phenomena (visual illusions, feeling of presence and passage hallucinations) and to describe the characteristics of the latter in a non-clinical older population. Methods: Three hundred and thirteen individuals aged 60 years and older, without cognitive deficits (according to mini-mental state examination scores) or patent psychotic disease, answered a structured questionnaire focusing on delusions, hallucinations and minor phenomena that they had experienced in the previous month. The study sample was stratified by age and gender according to French demographic characteristics. Results: Twenty per cent of participants reported one or more psychotic phenomena. These subjects did not differ from those without psychotic symptoms as regards their age,mini-mental state examination scores or education.Minor phenomena were the most common (13%). Hallucinations, in any sensory modality, occurred in 9% of participants. No verbal auditory hallucinations or delusions were reported. The prevalence of minor phenomena increased with age and was associated with the use of psychoactive drugs. Conclusion: By extending the spectrum of psychotic symptoms to minor phenomena, we found that psychotic symptoms were common in a non-clinical older population. Whether the increasing prevalence of minor phenomena with age is due to prodromal neurodegenerative disease or to other factors remains to be investigated.

AB  - Persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders often report high levels of childhood trauma, which often exacerbates symptoms and impede the process of recovery. However, little is known about how these traumas are experienced by service users and how they are integrated in their life stories. To examine this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 15 service users with a diagnosis of a first-episode nonaffective psychosis who had reported 1 or more childhood traumas in self-report measures. There was an unexpected discrepancy between the number of traumas reported in self-report measures and in semistructured interviews, and many of the traumas did not seem integrated in their personal narratives. The analyses further revealed that although participants often described complicated and traumatic childhood environments, they still felt supported by their families; they reported a range of ways in which they tried to cope with and gain control of their psychotic disorder, and they described a general optimistic view of the future.

AB  - The mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked potential, a preattentive brain response to a discriminable change in auditory stimulation, is significantly reduced in psychosis. Glutamatergic theories of psychosis propose that hypofunction of NMDA receptors (on pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons) causes a loss of synaptic gain control. We measured changes in neuronal effective connectivity underlying the MMN using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), where the gain (excitability) of superficial pyramidal cells is explicitly parameterised. EEG data were obtained during a MMN task-for 24 patients with psychosis, 25 of their first-degree unaffected relatives, and 35 controls-and DCM was used to estimate the excitability (modeled as self-inhibition) of (source-specific) superficial pyramidal populations. The MMN sources, based on previous research, included primary and secondary auditory cortices, and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Both patients with psychosis and unaffected relatives (to a lesser degree) showed increased excitability in right inferior frontal gyrus across task conditions, compared to controls. Furthermore, in the same region, both patients and their relatives showed a reversal of the normal response to deviant stimuli; that is, a decrease in excitability in comparison to standard conditions. Our results suggest that psychosis and genetic risk for the illness are associated with both context-dependent (condition-specific) and context-independent abnormalities of the excitability of superficial pyramidal cell populations in the MMN paradigm. These abnormalities could relate to NMDA receptor hypofunction on both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, and appear to be linked to the genetic aetiology of the illness, thereby constituting potential endophenotypes for psychosis.

PY  - 2016
AB  - Background: Deficits in the perception of social cues are common in schizophrenia and predict functional outcome. While effective communication depends on deciphering both verbal and non-verbal features, work on non-verbal communication in the disorder is scarce. Method: This behavioural study of 29 individuals with schizophrenia and 25 demographically matched controls used silent video-clips to examine gestural identification, its contextual modulation and related metacognitive representations. Results: In accord with our principal hypothesis, we observed that individuals with schizophrenia exhibited a preserved ability to identify archetypal gestures and did not differentially infer communicative intent from incidental movements. However, patients were more likely than controls to perceive gestures as self-referential when confirmatory evidence was ambiguous. Furthermore, the severity of their current hallucinatory experience inversely predicted their confidence ratings associated with these self-referential judgements. Conclusions: These findings suggest a deficit in the contextual refinement of social-cue processing in schizophrenia that is potentially attributable to impaired monitoring of a mirror mechanism underlying intentional judgements, or to an incomplete semantic representation of gestural actions. Non-verbal communication may be improved in patients through psychotherapeutic interventions that include performance and perception of gestures in group interactions.

AB  - Objective: Patients with schizophrenia are impaired in maintaining coherent perceptual experiences. This is reflected in the oscillatory theta response and can be investigated by visual illusions. Ambiguous stimuli elicit illusory perceptual switches while the stimulus remains unchanged. Methods: Theta responses elicited by an ambiguous and unambiguous control stimulus were measured using the EEG during time periods of perceptual switching and perceptual stability (non-switching). Results: For the ambiguous task, theta activity increased during perceptual switching in healthy controls only. For the unambiguous task, the switching-related increase of theta activity was larger in controls than in patients. This reduced modulation of the theta response seems not to be related to a general decrease of theta activity in patients. Conclusions: These findings may be related to disturbances in the spatio-temporal integration of neural activity in patients. Reporting ambiguous and unambiguous perceptual switches seems to be more demanding for patients with schizophrenia than healthy controls. Significance: This is one of the first studies on the neurophysiologic correlates of illusory perception in schizophrenia. Focussing on the relation between different brain states (such as switching and non-switching) might integrate different findings about altered theta oscillations in schizophrenia.

TI  - Health for smokers with schizophrenia: A struggle to maintain a dignified life
AU  - Sundgren, Elisabet
AU  - Hallqvist, Johan
AU  - Fredriksson, Lennart
PY  - 2016
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the health and lifestyle habits of smokers with schizophrenia and describe their experience of smoking in relation to health. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 10 smokers with schizophrenia were conducted in Sweden from May to October 2013. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to describe and interpret respondents' experiences. Findings: Good health for a person with schizophrenia was defined as accepting their mental illness, having strategies to gain control over psychotic symptoms, and engaging in activities and good relationships. Lifestyle habits were described as structures in the respondents' daily life: arising in the morning, taking a cigarette, reading the newspaper, eating breakfast and doing the things planned for the day. Conclusion: The meaning of health for smokers with schizophrenia is not the same as being well or ill. Rather, health is an experience of a struggle to maintain a dignified life, including self-acceptance of the mental illness and control over the psychotic symptoms. People with schizophrenia have high willingness but low motivation to stop smoking because they fear that cigarette withdrawal will increase their psychotic symptoms. Therefore, they find it difficult to stop smoking. To succeed with health care intervention, health care providers must understand the life style habits and experiences specific to smokers with schizophrenia and the unique experience of health and life style habits that people with schizophrenia experience. Implications for Rehabilitation: 1. Smokers with schizophrenia experience health as a struggle to maintain a dignified life and to maintain control over their psychotic symptoms. 2. In smoking cessation programmes, health care providers must pay attention to the fear that people with schizophrenia have of losing control over their psychotic symptoms, if they stop smoking, and support them to find activities to replace smoking. 3. This study suggests that to provide good support in health prevention for people with schizophrenia, it is vital for the health care provider to understand their unique personal experience of health and life style habits.

AB  - Psychophysical surround suppression is believed to reflect inhibitory neuronal mechanisms in visual cortex. In recent years, two psychophysical measures of surround suppression have been much studied: (i) duration thresholds on a motion-discrimination task (which are worse for larger than for smaller stimuli) and (ii) contrast thresholds on a contrast-detection task (which are worse when grating stimuli are surrounded by a stimulus of the same orientation than when they are presented in isolation or surrounded by a stimulus of orthogonal orientation). Changes in both metrics have been linked to several different human conditions, including aging, differences in intelligence, and clinical disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and autism. However, the exact nature of the neuronal correlate underlying these phenomena remains unclear. Here, we use an individual-differences approach to test the hypothesis that both measures reflect the same property of the visual system, e.g., the strength of GABA-ergic inhibition across visual cortex. Under this hypothesis we would expect the two measures to be significantly positively correlated across individuals. In fact, they are not significantly correlated. In addition, we replicate the previously reported correlation between age and motion-discrimination surround suppression, but find no correlation between age and contrast-detection surround suppression. We conclude that the two forms of psychophysical surround suppression arise independently from different cortical mechanisms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Schallmo, M.-P

PY  - 2015
AB  - Background: The salience of a visual stimulus is often reduced by nearby stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression of perceived contrast, which may help in locating the borders of an object. Weaker surround suppression has been observed in schizophrenia but it is unclear whether this abnormality is present in other mental disorders with similar symptomatology, or is evident in people with genetic liability for schizophrenia. Method: By examining surround suppression among subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, their unaffected biological relatives and healthy controls we sought to determine whether diminished surround suppression was specific to schizophrenia, and if subjects with a genetic risk for either disorder would show similar deficits. Measuring perceived contrast in different surround conditions also allowed us to investigate how this suppression depends on the similarity of target and surrounding stimuli. Results: Surround suppression was weaker among schizophrenia patients regardless of surround configuration. Subjects with bipolar affective disorder showed an intermediate deficit, with stronger suppression than in schizophrenia but weaker than control subjects. Surround suppression was normal in relatives of both patient groups. Findings support a deficit in broadly tuned (rather than sharply orientation- or direction-selective) suppression mechanisms. Conclusions: Weak broadly tuned suppression during visual perception is evident in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, consistent with impaired gain control related to the clinical expression of these conditions.

TI  - Suppressive mechanisms in visual motion processing: From perception to intelligence
AU  - Tadin, Duje
PY  - 2015
AB  - Perception operates on an immense amount of incoming information that greatly exceeds the brain's processing capacity. Because of this fundamental limitation, the ability to suppress irrelevant information is a key determinant of perceptual efficiency. Here, I will review a series of studies investigating suppressive mechanisms in visual motion processing, namely perceptual suppression of large, background-like motions. These spatial suppression mechanisms are adaptive, operating only when sensory inputs are sufficiently robust to guarantee visibility. Converging correlational and causal evidence links these behavioral results with inhibitory center-surround mechanisms, namely those in cortical area MT. Spatial suppression is abnormally weak in several special populations, including the elderly and individuals with schizophrenia-a deficit that is evidenced by better-than-normal direction discriminations of large moving stimuli. Theoretical work shows that this abnormal weakening of spatial suppression should result in motion segregation deficits, but direct behavioral support of this hypothesis is lacking. Finally, I will argue that the ability to suppress information is a fundamental neural process that applies not only to perception but also to cognition in general. Supporting this argument, I will discuss recent research that shows individual differences in spatial suppression of motion signals strongly predict individual variations in IQ scores.

AB  - Impaired visual context processing is closely linked with expression of symptoms in people with psychosis. However, to date, there have been no investigations of this phenomenon in the critical ultra high-risk (UHR) period immediately preceding the onset of psychosis. In total, 73 participants (33 UHR, 40 control) were evaluated with clinical and global functioning interviews and with a computerized task that required comparing the size of 2 target circles. Targets could appear by themselves (no-context condition), or within a context that made size judgment easier (helpful condition) or more difficult (misleading condition). Susceptibility to illusion was measured as the accuracy differences between the no-context and the helpful (i.e., helpful-index) and the misleading (i.e., misleading-index) conditions. Both groups exhibited approximately the same percentage of accurate responses to the no-context condition. However, the UHR subjects exhibited significantly less susceptibility to the illusion, performing superior to controls on the misleading index. The UHR group also showed less susceptibility on the helpful index, but this was not significant. Lower susceptibility on the misleading index was associated with increased negative symptoms and role functioning at a trend level. Lower susceptibility on the helpful index was significantly associated with increased negative symptoms and both poor role and social functioning. These results indicate that visual context processing is impaired during the UHR period, and is related to core illness features, suggesting that this task may be a useful biomarker in studies of UHR participants.

AB  - People with schizophrenia are impaired at organizing potentially ambiguous visual information into well-formed shape and object representations. This perceptual organization (PO) impairment has not been found in other psychiatric disorders. However, recent data on body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), suggest that BDD may also be characterized by reduced PO. Similarities between these groups could have implications for understanding the RDoC dimension of visual perception in psychopathology, and for modeling symptom formation across these two conditions. We compared patients with SCZ (n = 24) to those with BDD (n = 20), as well as control groups of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20), on two measures of PO that have been reliably associated with schizophrenia-related performance impairment. On both the contour integration and Ebbinghaus illusion tests, only the SCZ group demonstrated abnormal performance relative to controls; the BDD group performed similarly to the OCD and CON groups. In addition, on both tasks, the SCZ group performed more abnormally than the BDD group. Overall, these data suggest that PO reductions observed in SCZ are not present in BDD. Visual processing impairments in BDD may arise instead from other perceptual disturbances or attentional biases related to emotional factors.

AB  - Background: Through self-management, people living with depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders can play an active role in their recovery. However, absence of a validated questionnaire limits empirical research on self-management. The study aimed to develop a French instrument, the Mental Health Self-Management Questionnaire (MHSQ), and to investigate its psychometric properties Methods: A pool of 86 items was created based on a qualitative study with 50 people in recovery from depression, anxiety or bipolar disorders. The 64 most pertinent items were identified following ratings from 14 experts. A sample of 149 people in recovery completed these items and criterion-related measures (specific aspects of self-management, clinical and personal recovery, social desirability), and 93 participants also completed MHSQ two weeks later Results: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses show that MHSQ is composed of three subscales: Clinical (getting help and using resources), Empowerment (building upon strengths and positive self-concept to gain control) and Vitality (active and healthy lifestyle). These subscales had satisfying consistency and test-retest reliability, and were mostly unrelated to social desirability. Correlations with criterion variables support convergent and concurrent validity, especially for Empowerment and Vitality. Comparison of structural models provides evidence of the distinct nature of MHSQ in comparison to the constructs of clinical and personal recovery Limitations: Longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to explore the validity of MHSQ for predicting recovery over time Conclusion: MHSQ is a psychometrically-sound instrument, useful for establishing the role of self-management in recovery and monitoring the efficacy of self-management support programs.

AB  - Background: Pareidolia, which is a particular type of complex visual illusion, has been reported to be a phenomenon analogous to visual hallucinations in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. However, whether pareidolia is observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) or whether there are common underlying mechanisms of these two types of visual misperceptions remains to be elucidated. Methods: A test to evoke pareidolia, the Pareidolia test, was administered to 53 patients with PD without dementia and 24 healthy controls. The regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the PD patients. Results: PD patients without dementia produced a greater number of pareidolic illusions compared with the controls. Pareidolia was observed in all of the patients having visual hallucinations as well as a subset of those without visual hallucinations. The number of pareidolic illusions was correlated with hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal, parietal and occipital cortices. The index of visual hallucinations was correlated with hypometabolism in the left parietal cortex. A region associated with both pareidolia and visual hallucinations was found in the left parietal lobe. Conclusions: Our study suggests that PD patients without dementia experience pareidolia more frequently than healthy controls and that posterior cortical dysfunction could be a common neural mechanism of pareidolia and visual hallucinations. Pareidolia could represent subclinical hallucinations or a predisposition to visual hallucinations in Lewy body disease. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A broad neuron-centric conception of contextual modulation is reviewed and re-assessed in the light of recent neurobiological studies of amplification, suppression, and synchronization. Behavioural and computational studies of perceptual and higher cognitive functions that depend on these processes are outlined, and evidence that those functions and their neuronal mechanisms are impaired in schizophrenia is summarized. Finally, we compare and assess the long-term biological functions of contextual modulation at the level of computational theory as formalized by the theories of coherent infomax and free energy reduction. We conclude that those theories, together with the many empirical findings reviewed, show how contextual modulation at the neuronal level enables the cortex to flexibly adapt the use of its knowledge to current circumstances by amplifying and grouping relevant activities and by suppressing irrelevant activities.

AB  - Visual paradigms are versatile tools to investigate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Contextual modulation refers to a class of paradigms where a target is flanked by neighbouring elements, which either deteriorate or facilitate target perception. It is often proposed that contextual modulation is weakened in schizophrenia compared to controls, with facilitating contexts being less facilitating and deteriorating contexts being less deteriorating. However, results are mixed. In addition, facilitating and deteriorating effects are usually determined in different paradigms, making comparisons difficult. Here, we used a crowding paradigm in which both facilitation and deterioration effects can be determined all together. We found a main effect of group, i.e., patients performed worse in all conditions compared to controls. However, when we discounted for this main effect, facilitation and deterioration were well comparable to controls. Our results indicate that contextual modulation can be intact in schizophrenia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: A number of cognitive underpinnings of auditory hallucinations have been established in schizophrenia patients, but few have, as yet, been uncovered for visual hallucinations. In previous research, we unexpectedly observed that auditory hallucinations were associated with poor recognition of color, but not black-and-white (b/w), pictures. In this study, we attempted to replicate and explain this finding. Potential associations with visual hallucinations were explored. Method: B/w and color pictures were presented to 50 schizophrenia patients and 45 healthy individuals under 2 conditions of visual context presentation corresponding to 2 levels of visual encoding complexity. Then, participants had to recognize the target pictures among distractors. Results: Auditory-verbal hallucinations were inversely associated with the recognition of the color pictures presented under the most effortful encoding condition. This association was fully mediated by working-memory span. Visual hallucinations were associated with improved recognition of the color pictures presented under the less effortful condition. Patients suffering from visual hallucinations were not impaired, relative to the healthy participants, in the recognition of these pictures. Conclusion: Decreased working-memory span in patients with auditory-verbal hallucinations might impede the effortful encoding of stimuli. Visual hallucinations might be associated with facilitation in the visual encoding of natural scenes, or with enhanced color perception abilities.

AB  - A well-studied paradox of motion perception is that, in order to correctly judge direction in high-contrast stimuli, subjects need to observe motion for longer in large stimuli than in small stimuli. This effect is one of several perceptual effects known generally as "surround suppression." It is usually attributed to center-surround antagonism between neurons in visual cortex, believed to be mediated by GABAergic inhibition. Accordingly, several studies have reported that this index of surround suppression is reduced in groups known to have reduced GABA-ergic inhibition, including older people and people with schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. In this study,we examined the effect on this index of moderate amounts of ethanol alcohol. Among its many effects on the nervous system, alcohol potentiates GABA-ergic transmission.We therefore hypothesized that it should further impair the perception of motion in large stimuli, resulting in a stronger surround-suppression index. This prediction was not borne out. Alcohol consumption slightly worsened duration thresholds for both large and small stimuli, but their ratio did not change significantly.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Schizophrenia patients poorly perceive Kanizsa figures and integrate co-aligned contour elements (Gabors). They also poorly process low spatial frequencies (SFs), which presumably reflects dysfunction along the dorsal pathway. Can contour grouping deficits be explained in terms of the spatial frequency content of the display elements? To address the question, we tested patients and matched controls on three contour grouping paradigms in which the SF composition was modulated. In the Kanizsa task, subjects discriminated quartets of sectored circles (:pac-men") that either formed or did not form Kanizsa shapes (illusory and fragmented conditions, respectively). In contour integration, subjects identified the screen quadrant thought to contain a closed chain of co-circular Gabors. In collinear facilitation, subjects attempted to detect a central low-contrast element flanked by collinear or orthogonal high-contrast elements, and facilitation corresponded to the amount by which collinear flankers reduced contrast thresholds. We varied SF by modifying the element features in the Kanizsa task and by scaling the entire stimulus display in the remaining tasks (SFs ranging from 4 to 12 cycles/deg). Irrespective of SF, patients were worse at discriminating illusory, but not fragmented shapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, collinear facilitation and contour integration were abnormal in the clinical group only for the higher SF (> = 10 c/deg). Grouping performance correlated with clinical variables, such as conceptual disorganization, general symptoms, and levels of functioning. In schizophrenia, three forms of contour grouping impairments prominently arise and cannot be attributed to poor low SF processing. Neurobiological and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - Vertebrate vision relies on two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which signal increments in light intensity with graded hyperpolarizations. Rods operate in the lower range of light intensities while cones operate at brighter intensities. The receptive fields of both photoreceptors exhibit antagonistic center-surround organization. Here we show that at bright light levels, mouse rods act as relay cells for cone-driven horizontal cell-mediated surround inhibition. In response to large, bright stimuli that activate their surrounds, rods depolarize. Rod depolarization increases with stimulus size, and its action spectrum matches that of cones. Rod responses at high light levels are abolished in mice with nonfunctional cones and when horizontal cells are reversibly inactivated. Rod depolarization is conveyed to the inner retina via postsynaptic circuit elements, namely the rod bipolar cells. Our results show that the retinal circuitry repurposes rods, when they are not directly sensing light, to relay cone-driven surround inhibition.

TI  - The tilt illusion: Phenomenology and functional implications
AU  - Clifford, Colin W. G
PY  - 2014
AB  - The perceived orientation of a line or grating is affected by the orientation structure of the surrounding image: the tilt illusion. Here, I offer a selective review of the literature on the tilt illusion, focusing on functional aspects. The review explores the merits of mechanistic accounts of the tilt illusion based upon sensory gain control in which neuronal responses are normalized by the pooled activity of other units. The role of inhibition between orientation-selective neurons is discussed, and it is argued that their associated disinhibition must also be taken into account in order to model the full angular dependence of the tilt illusion on surround orientation. Parallels are drawn with adaptation as modulation by the temporal rather than spatial context within which an image fragment is processed. The chromatic selectivity of the tilt illusion and the extent of its dependence on the visibility of the surround are used to infer characteristics of the neuronal normalization pools and the loci in the cortical processing hierarchy at which gain control operates. Finally, recent evidence is discussed as to the possible clinical relevance of the tilt illusion as a biomarker for schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abstract Repetitive patterning facilitates inferences about likely properties of sound to follow. Mismatch negativity (MMN) occurs when sound fails to match an inference. Smaller MMN in schizophrenia indexes deficient gain control (difference in utilizing a limited dynamic range). Although it is clear that this group has a lower limit to MMN size, this study addressed whether smaller MMN indicates impaired perceptual inference. MMN was elicited to four deviants in two sequences: one in which occurrence was random and one in which it was paired. Despite smaller MMN, persons with schizophrenia are equally able to reduce MMN size evoked by a deviant when its occurrence is cued. Results also expose alterations in the evoked response to repeated sounds that appear to be exacerbations of age-related amplitude decline. Since these anomalies impact the computed MMN, they highlight the need to identify all contributions to limits in gain control in schizophrenia.

AB  - Studies revealed that patients with paranoid schizophrenia display overconfidence in errors for memory and social cognition tasks. The present investigation examined whether this pattern holds true for visual perception tasks. Nonclinical participants were recruited via an online panel. Individuals were asked to complete a questionnaire that included the Paranoia Checklist and were then presented with 24 blurry pictures; half contained a hidden object while the other half showed snowy (visual) noise. Participants were asked to state whether the visual items contained an object and how confident they were in their judgment. Data from 1966 individuals were included following a conservative selection process. Participants high on core paranoid symptoms showed a poor calibration of confidence for correct versus incorrect responses. In particular, participants high on paranoia displayed overconfidence in incorrect responses and demonstrated a 20% error rate for responses made with high confidence compared to a 12% error rate in participants with low paranoia scores. Interestingly, paranoia scores declined after performance of the task. For the first time, overconfidence in errors was demonstrated among individuals with high levels of paranoia using a visual perception task, tentatively suggesting it is a ubiquitous phenomenon. In view of the significant decline in paranoia across time, bias modification programs may incorporate items such as the one employed here to teach patients with clinical paranoia the fallibility of human cognition, which may foster subsequent symptom improvement.

AB  - Research in schizophrenia has increasingly focused on incorporating measures from cognitive neuroscience, but little is known about their psychometric characteristics. Here, we extend prior research by reporting on temporal stability, as well as age and sex effects, for cognitive neuroscience paradigms optimized as part of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical applications for Schizophrenia consortium. Ninety-nine outpatients with schizophrenia and 131 healthy controls performed 5 tasks assessing 4 constructs at 3 sessions. The constructs were (1) Goal maintenance (Dot Probe Expectancy [DPX] and AX continuous performance tasks [AX-CPT]); (2) Episodic memory (Relational and Item-Specific Encoding and Retrieval task [RiSE]); (3) Visual integration (Jittered Orientation Visual Integration task [JOVI]); and (4) Perceptual gain control (Contrast- Contrast Effect Task [CCE]). Patients performed worse than controls on all but the CCE, and the magnitude of these group differences was stable across sessions, with no sex differences observed. Improvements over sessions were seen for the AX-CPT, the DPX, and the JOVI though practice effects for the AX-CPT and the DPX were primarily present in older participants. For the AX-CPT and the JOVI, practice effects were larger for T1 to T2 than for T2 to T3. Age was associated with poor associative recognition on the RiSE and accuracy on the JOVI. Test-rest reliability ranged from poor for the JOVI threshold score to adequate to good for the DPX, AX-CPT, and JOVI accuracy measures, with RiSE and CCE measures in the moderate range. These results suggest that group differences in DPX, AX-CPT, RiSE, and JOVI are robust and consistent across repeated testing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Can antipsychotic treatment contribute to drug addiction in schizophrenia?
AU  - Samaha, Anne-Noel
PY  - 2014
AB  - Individuals with schizophrenia are at very high risk for drug abuse and addiction. Patients with a coexisting drug problem fare worse than patients who do not use drugs, and are also more difficult to treat. Current hypotheses cannot adequately account for why patients with schizophrenia so often have a co-morbid drug problem. I present here a complementary hypothesis based on evidence showing that chronic exposure to antipsychotic medications can induce supersensitivity within the brain's dopamine systems, and that this in turn can enhance the rewarding and incentive motivational effects of drugs and reward cues. At the neurobiological level, these effects of antipsychotics are potentially linked to antipsychotic-induced increases in the striatal levels of dopamine D2 receptors and D2 receptors in a high-affinity state for dopamine, particularly at postsynaptic sites. Antipsychotic-induced dopamine supersensitivity and enhanced reward function are not inevitable consequences of prolonged antipsychotic treatment. At least two parameters appear to promote these effects; the use of antipsychotics of the typical class, and continuous rather than intermittent antipsychotic exposure, such that silencing of dopaminergic neurotransmission via D2/3 receptors is unremitting. Thus, by inducing forms of neural plasticity that facilitate the ability of drugs and reward cues to gain control over behaviour, some currently used treatment strategies with typical antipsychotics might contribute to compulsive drug seeking and drug taking behaviours in vulnerable schizophrenia patients.

AB  - Background: Impairments in mismatch negativity (MMN) generation have been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. However, underlying oscillatory activity of MMN deficits in schizophrenia and the relationship with cognitive impairments have not been investigated in detail. Time-frequency power and phase analyses can provide more detailed measures of brain dynamics of MMN deficits in schizophrenia. Method: 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls were tested with a roving frequency paradigm to generate MMN. Time-frequency domain power and phase-locking (PL) analysis was performed on all trials using short-time Fourier transforms with Hanning window tapering. A comprehensive battery (CANTAB) was used to assess neurocognitive functioning. Results: Mean MMN amplitude was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (95% CI 0.18 - 0.77). Patients showed significantly lower EEG power (95% CI -1.02 - -0.014) in the ~4-7 Hz frequency range (theta band) between 170 and 210 ms. Patients with schizophrenia showed cognitive impairment in multiple domains of CANTAB. However, MMN impairments in amplitude and power were not correlated with clinical measures, medication dose, social functioning or neurocognitive performance. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggested that while MMN may be a useful marker to probe NMDA receptor mediated mechanisms and associated impairments in gain control and perceptual changes, it may not be a useful marker in association with clinical or cognitive changes. Trial-by-trial EEG power analysis can be used as a measure of brain dynamics underlying MMN deficits which also can have implications for the use of MMN as a biomarker for drug discovery.

AB  - Schizophrenia patients demonstrate perceptual deficits consistent with broad dysfunction in visual context processing. These include poor integration of segments forming visual contours, and reduced visual contrast effects (e.g. weaker orientation-dependent surround suppression, ODSS). Background image context can influence contour perception, as stimuli near the contour affect detection accuracy. Because of ODSS, this contextual modulation depends on the relative orientation between the contour and flanking elements, with parallel flankers impairing contour perception. However in schizophrenia, the impact of abnormal ODSS during contour perception is not clear. It is also unknown whether deficient contour perception marks genetic liability for schizophrenia, or is strictly associated with clinical expression of this disorder. We examined contour detection in 25 adults with schizophrenia, 13 unaffected first-degree biological relatives of schizophrenia patients, and 28 healthy controls. Subjects performed a psychophysics experiment designed to quantify the effect of flanker orientation during contour detection. Overall, patients with schizophrenia showed poorer contour detection performance than relatives or controls. Parallel flankers suppressed and orthogonal flankers enhanced contour detection performance for all groups, but parallel suppression was relatively weaker for schizophrenia patients than healthy controls. Relatives of patients showed equivalent performance with controls. Computational modeling suggested that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia may be explained by suppression that is more broadly tuned for orientation. Abnormal flanker suppression in schizophrenia is consistent with weaker ODSS and/or broader orientation tuning. This work provides the first evidence that such perceptual abnormalities may not be associated with a genetic liability for schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper summarizes the discussions regarding animal paradigms for assessing perception at the seventh meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS). A breakout group at the meeting addressed candidate tests in animals that might best parallel the human paradigms selected previously in the CNTRICS program to assess two constructs in the domain of perception: gain control and visual integration. The perception breakout group evaluated the degree to which each of the nominated tasks met pre-specified criteria: comparability of tasks across multiple species; construct validity; neuroanatomical homology between species; and dynamic range across parametric variation.

AB  - Schizophrenia is typically associated with higher-level cognitive symptoms, such as disorganized thoughts, delusions and hallucinations. However, deficits in visual processing have been consistently reported with the illness. Here we provide strong neurophysiological evidence for a marked perturbation at the earliest level of cortical visual processing in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Using fMRI and adapting a well-established approach from electrophysiology, we found that orientation-specific contextual modulation of cortical responses in human primary visual cortex (V1)-a hallmark of early neural encoding of visual stimuli-is dramatically reduced in patients with schizophrenia. This indicates that contextual processing in schizophrenia is altered at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing and supports current theories that emphasize the role of abnormalities in perceptual synthesis (eg, false inference) in schizophrenia.

AB  - Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 microg/kg vs placebo) on both alpha oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mgvs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital alpha power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced alpha power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of alpha oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Background: Detection of visual contours (strings of small oriented elements) is markedly poor in schizophrenia. This has previously been attributed to an inability to group local information across space into a global percept. Here, we show that this failure actually originates from a combination of poor encoding of local orientation and abnormal processing of visual context. Method(s): We measured the ability of observers with schizophrenia to localise contours embedded in backgrounds of differently oriented elements (either randomly oriented, near-parallel or near-perpendicular to the contour). In addition, we measured patients' ability to process local orientation information (i.e., report the orientation of an individual element) for both isolated and crowded elements (i.e., presented with nearby distractors). Result(s): While patients are poor at detecting contours amongst randomly oriented elements, they are proportionally less disrupted (compared to unaffected controls) when contour and surrounding elements have similar orientations (near-parallel condition). In addition, patients are poor at reporting the orientation of an individual element but, again, are less prone to interference from nearby distractors, a phenomenon known as visual crowding. Conclusion(s): We suggest that patients' poor performance at contour perception arises not as a consequence of an "integration deficit" but from a combination of reduced sensitivity to local orientation and abnormalities in contextual processing. We propose that this is a consequence of abnormal gain control, a phenomenon that has been implicated in orientation-selectivity as well as surround suppression. <c2><a9> 2013 Robol et al.

AB  - Purpose. Visual hallucinations (VHs) occur in macular degeneration patients with poor vision but normal cognitive function. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We report the identification of pharmaceutical agents that enhance VH and use these agents to examine the contribution of retinal neurons to this syndrome. Methods. We detail clinical observations on VH in five macular degeneration patients treated with proton pump inhibitors having the core structure, 2-pyridyl-methylsulfinyl-benzimidazole. We tested possible retinal mechanisms using paired whole cell recordings to examine effects of these compounds on feedback interactions between horizontal cells and cones in amphibian retina. Results. Five patients with advanced wet macular degeneration described patterned VHs that were induced or enhanced by oral proton pump inhibitors. The abnormal images increased with light, disappeared in the dark, and originated in the retina, based on ophthalmodynamometry. Simultaneous paired whole cell recordings from amphibian cones and horizontal cells showed that 2-pyridyl-methylsulfinyl-benzimidazoles blocked the negative shift in voltage dependence and increase in amplitude of the calcium current (ICa) in cones that is induced by changes in horizontal cell membrane potential. These effects disrupt the negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones that is important for the formation of center-surround receptive fields in bipolar and ganglion cells, and thus for normal spatial and chromatic perception. Conclusions. Our study suggests that changes in the output of retinal neurons caused by disturbances in outer retinal feedback mechanisms can enhance patterned visual hallucinations. <c2><a9> 2013 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

PY  - 2013
AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia show decreased sensitivity towards clinical and experimental painful conditions. To date, the exact underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. One method to examine central integrative processes of pain perception is the thermal grill illusion (TGI), in which interlacing cold and warm bars create the illusion of a painful sensation. Methods: In 18 unmedicated patients with acute paranoid schizophrenia, cold and heat pain thresholds (CPT/HPT) as well as the perception of the TGI were examined and compared to 18 matched controls. In addition, symptom scales were obtained in order to relate pain perception to psychopathology. Results: CPT and HPT were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. In the range of TGI stimuli that were perceived painful by controls, patients did not indicate painful sensations, instead the stimulus response curve of TGI pain perception was shifted towards higher stimulus intensities, i.e., greater temperature differentials between cold and warm bars. This increase was comparable to that seen in CPT and HPT. There was no association with psychopathology for any pain parameter. Conclusions: CPT and HPT, as well as temperature differentials for the perception of the TGI were increased in patients with schizophrenia as compared to controls. Similar to visual illusions, in which reduced contrast sensitivity has been shown to alter the perception of illusions, the discriminatory somatosensory deficit, which is reflected in higher CPT and HPT as well as the previously reported increased warmth perception thresholds, might account for the attenuation of TGI in patients.

AB  - Background: There is evidence that patients with schizophrenia benefit from standard cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) only if active techniques are used ('full therapy'). By contrast, attending sessions but not proceeding beyond engagement and assessment strategies ('partial therapy'), or simply not attending sessions ('no therapy'), is not associated with better outcomes. The factors leading to full therapy are unknown. We hypothesized that patients' initial ideas about the nature and extent of their problems would predict use of CBT. A match between patients' views of their problems and the principles underlying treatment would lead to better outcomes. Method: Ninety-two patients with a recent relapse of psychosis completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) before receiving CBT. We examined whether their illness perceptions predicted the take-up of therapy. Results: Patients who did not attend sessions believed their problems would not last as long as those who attended them. Those who attended sessions but did not proceed to full therapy had a lower sense of control over their problems and a more biological view of their causes. Patients who took up full therapy were more likely to attribute the cause of their problems to their personality and state of mind. The take-up of therapy was predicted neither by levels of psychiatric symptoms nor by insight. Conclusions: People with psychosis who have psychologically orientated views of their problems, including the potential to gain control over them, may be more likely to engage fully and do well with standard CBT for psychosis, irrespective of the severity of their problems.

AB  - Visual processing studies have repeatedly shown impairment in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Electroencephalography (EEG) and, specifically, visual evoked potential (VEP) studies have identified an early marker of this impairment in the form of a decrement in the P1 component of the VEP in patients and their clinically unaffected first-degree relatives. Much behavioral and neuroimaging research has implicated specific dysfunction of either the subcortical magnocellular pathway or the cortical visual dorsal stream in this impairment. In this study, EEG responses were obtained to the contrast modulation of checkerboard stimuli using the VESPA (Visual Evoked Spread Spectrum Analysis) method. This was done for a high contrast condition and, in order to bias the stimuli towards the magnocellular pathway, a low contrast condition. Standard VEPs were also obtained using high contrast pattern reversing checkerboards. Responses were measured using high-density electrical scalp recordings in 29 individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and in 18 control subjects. Replicating previous research, a large (Cohen's d =1.11) reduction in the P1 component of the VEP was seen in patients when compared with controls with no corresponding difference in the VESPA response to high contrast stimuli. In addition, the low-contrast VESPA displayed no difference between patients and controls. Furthermore, no differences were seen between patients and controls for the C1 components of either the VEP or the high-contrast VESPA. Based on the differing acquisition methods between VEP and VESPA, we discuss these results in terms of contrast gain control and the possibility of dysfunction at the cortical level with initial afferent activity into V1 along the magnocellular pathway being intact when processing is biased towards that pathway using low contrast stimuli.

AB  - The goal of the current project was to further develop a measure of gain control-the Contrast-Contrast Effect (CCE)-for use in clinical studies of schizophrenia. The CCE is based on an illusion in which presenting a medium contrast patch surrounded by a high-contrast patch induces individuals to perceive that center patch as having lower contrast than when the patch is presented in isolation. Thus, in the CCE, impaired gain control should lead to more accurate perceptions of the center patch. We tested 132 individuals with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 130 demographically similar healthy controls. The results indicated that the CCE effect can be obtained with standard equipment, simplified scoring, and a short interstimulus interval (100 ms), revealing a robust suppression of perceived contrast of the center patch when surrounded by a high-contrast annulus. Furthermore, we found a significant reduction in the effect of the high-contrast surround among individuals with schizophrenia, though the effect size was smaller than original reported by Dakin. However, when we eliminated subjects who performed poorly on "catch" trials that controlled for off-task performance, the reduced surround effect among patients was no longer significant in the main analyses. Importantly, this suggests that at least part of the reduced surround effect (if not all) in schizophrenia could be attributable to impaired attentional mechanisms that contribute to off-task performance. Additional analyses suggested that the length of the task could be shortened without losing power to detect surround effects in healthy individuals.

AB  - The goal of the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for Schizophrenia (CNTRACS) Consortium was to develop measures of discrete cognitive processes, allowing for the interpretation of specific deficits that could be linked to specific neural systems. Here we report on the intertask, clinical, and functional correlates of the 4 tasks that were investigated in large groups of patients with schizophrenia (>100) and healthy controls (>73) at 5 sites across the United States. In both healthy and patient groups, the key dependent measures from the CNTRACS tasks were minimally intercorrelated, suggesting that they are measuring discrete abilities. Correlations were examined between CNTRACS tasks and measures of functional capacity, premorbid IQ, symptom severity, and level of community functioning. Performance on tasks measuring relational memory encoding, goal maintenance, and visual gain control were correlated with premorbid IQ and the former 2 tasks with the functional capacity. Goal maintenance task performance was negatively correlated with negative symptom severity and informant reports of community function. These correlations reflect the relationship of specific abilities with functional outcome. They are somewhat lower than functional outcome correlations observed with conventional neuropsychological tests that confound multiple cognitive and motivational deficits. The measures of visual integration and gain control were not significantly correlated with clinical symptoms or function. These results suggest that the CNTRACS tasks measure discrete cognitive abilities, some of which relate to aspects of functional capacity/outcome in schizophrenia.

AB  - The sixth meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) focused on selecting promising imaging paradigms for each of the cognitive constructs selected in the first CNTRICS meeting. In the domain of perception, the 2 constructs of interest were "gain control" and "visual integration." CNTRICS received 6 task nominations for imaging paradigms for gain control and 3 task nominations for integration. The breakout group for perception evaluated the degree to which each of these tasks met prespecified criteria. For gain control, the breakout group believed that one task (mismatch negativity) was already mature and was being incorporated into multisite clinical trials. The breakout group recommended that 1 visual task (steady-state visual evoked potentials to magnocellular-vs parvocellular-biased stimuli) and 2 auditory measures (an event-related potential (ERP) measure of corollary discharge and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) version of prepulse inhibition of startle) be adapted for use in clinical trials in schizophrenia research. For visual integration, the breakout group recommended that fMRI and ERP versions of a contour integration test and an fMRI version of a coherent motion test be adapted for use in clinical trials. This manuscript describes the ways in which each of these tasks met the criteria used in the breakout group to evaluate and recommend tasks for further development.

TI  - Visual context processing deficits in schizophrenia: Effects of deafness and disorganization
AU  - Horton, Heather K
AU  - Silverstein, Steven M
PY  - 2011
AB  - Visual illusions allow for strong tests of perceptual functioning. Perceptual impairments can produce superior task performance on certain tasks (ie, more veridical perception), thereby avoiding generalized deficit confounds while tapping mechanisms that are largely outside of conscious control. Using a task based on the Ebbinghaus illusion, a perceptual phenomenon where the perceived size of a central target object is affected by the size of surrounding inducers, we tested hypotheses related to visual integration in deaf (n = 31) and hearing (n = 34) patients with schizophrenia. In past studies, psychiatrically healthy samples displayed increased visual integration relative to schizophrenia samples and thus were less able to correctly judge target sizes. Deafness, and especially the use of sign language, leads to heightened sensitivity to peripheral visual cues and increased sensitivity to visual context. Therefore, relative to hearing subjects, deaf subjects were expected to display increased context sensitivity (ie, a more normal illusion effect as evidenced by a decreased ability to correctly judge central target sizes). Confirming the hypothesis, deaf signers were significantly more sensitive to the illusion than nonsigning hearing patients. Moreover, an earlier age of sign language acquisition, higher levels of linguistic ability, and shorter illness duration were significantly related to increased context sensitivity. As predicted, disorganization was associated with reduced context sensitivity for all subjects. The primary implications of these data are that perceptual organization impairment in schizophrenia is plastic and that it is related to a broader failure in coordinating cognitive activity.

TI  - Vision science and schizophrenia research: Toward a re-view of the disorder: Editors' introduction to the special section
AU  - Silverstein, Steven M
AU  - Keane, Brian P
PY  - 2011
AB  - This theme section on vision science and schizophrenia research demonstrates that our understanding of the disorder could be significantly accelerated by a greater adoption of the methods of vision science. In this introduction, we briefly describe what vision science is, how it has advanced our understanding of schizophrenia, and what challenges and opportunities lay ahead regarding schizophrenia research. We then summarize the articles that follow. These include reviews of abnormal form perception (perceptual organization and backward masking) and motion processing, and an article on reduced size contrast illusions experienced by hearing but not deaf persons with schizophrenia. These articles reveal that the methods of basic vision research can provide insights into a number of aspects of the disorder, including pathophysiology, development, cognition, social cognition, and phenomenology. Importantly, studies of visual processing in schizophrenia make it clear that there are impairments in the functioning of basic neural mechanisms (eg, center-surround modulation, contextual modulation of feedforward processing, reentrant processing) that are found throughout the cortex and that are operative in multiple forms of cognitive dysfunction in the illness. Such evidence allows for an updated view of schizophrenia as a condition involving generalized failures in neural network formation and maintenance, as opposed to a primary failure in a higher level factor (eg, cognitive control) that accounts for all other types of perceptual and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, studies of vision in schizophrenia can identify sensitive probes of neural functioning that can be used as biomarkers of treatment response.

AB  - Background: A feeling of presence (FP), that is, the vivid sensation that somebody (distinct from oneself) is present nearby, is commonly reported by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but its phenomenology has not been described precisely. The objective of this study was to provide a detailed description of FP in PD and to discuss its possible mechanisms. Patients and methods: The authors studied 52 nondemented PD patients reporting FP in the preceding month (38 consecutive outpatients and 14 inpatients). FP characteristics were recorded with a structured questionnaire. The outpatients with FP were compared with 78 consecutive outpatients without FP. Results: About half the patients said they recognised the 'identity' of the presence. More than 75% of patients said the FP were not distressing, were short-lasting, were felt beside and/or behind the patient, and occurred while indoors; most patients checked for a real presence, but their insight was generally preserved. In 31% of cases, the patients had an unformed visual hallucination simultaneously with the FP. A higher daily levodopa-equivalent dose and the presence of visual illusions or hallucinations were independently associated with FP. Discussion: Although FP is not a sensory perception, projection of the sensation into the extrapersonal space, along with the frequent co-occurrence of elementary visual hallucinations and the strong association with visual hallucinations or illusions, supports its hallucinatory nature. FP may be viewed as a 'social' hallucination, involving an area or network specifically activated when a living being is present, independently of any perceptual clue.

TI  - Dreaming and hallucinations - continuity or discontinuity? Perspectives from dementia with Lewy bodies
AU  - Collerton, Daniel
AU  - Perry, Elaine
PY  - 2011
AB  - Comparing the phenomenology, neurochemical pathology, and psychopharmacology of hallucinations and dreaming is limited by the available data. Evidence to date reveals no simple correspondence between the two states. Differences in the phenomenology of visual hallucinations and the visual component of dreams may reflect variations in visual context acting on the same underlying mechanism - the minimal visual input during dreaming contrasts with the more substantial perceived context in hallucinations. Variations in cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter function during sleep and during hallucinations in Lewy body dementias, together with relevant drug effects suggest that, on the whole, different, potentially opposite, changes characterise the two states. A similar analysis of other psychotic features in Lewy body dementia and other disorders suggests that, in contrast to hallucinations, there may be more convincing parallels between dreaming and delusional states.

PY  - 2011
AB  - As stimulus size increases, motion direction of high-contrast patterns becomes increasingly harder to perceive. This counterintuitive behavioral result, termed "spatial suppression," is hypothesized to reflect center-surround antagonism-a receptive field property ubiquitous in sensory systems. Prior research proposed that spatial suppression of motion signals is a direct correlate of center-surround antagonism within cortical area MT. Here, we investigated whether human MT/V5 is indeed causally involved in spatial suppression of motion signals. The key assumption is that a disruption of neural mechanisms that play a critical role in spatial suppression could allow these normally suppressed motion signals to reach perceptual awareness. Thus, our hypothesis was that a disruption of MT/V5 should weaken spatial suppression and, consequently, improve motion perception of large, moving patterns. To disrupt MT/V5, we used offline 1 Hz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-a method that temporarily attenuates normal functioning of the targeted cortex. Early visual areas were also targeted as a control site. The results supported our hypotheses and showed that disruption of MT/V5 improved motion discrimination of large, moving stimuli, presumably by weakening surround suppression strength. This effect was specific to MT/V5 stimulation and contralaterally presented stimuli. Evidently, the critical neural constraints limiting motion perception of large, high-contrast stimuli involve MT/V5. Additionally, our findings mimic spatial suppression deficits that are observed in several patient populations and implicate impaired MT/V5 processes as likely neural correlates for the reported perceptual abnormalities in the elderly, patients with schizophrenia and those with a history of depression.

AB  - New criteria for Parkinson's disease-associated psychosis (PDAP) were recently proposed by a NINDS-NIMH working group. We assessed 116 consecutive unselected outpatients with PD for the existence of psychotic symptoms during the previous month, using a structured questionnaire covering the whole spectrum of PDAP symptoms. Hallucinations occurred in 42% of the patients (visual: 16%; nonvisual: 35%), delusions in 4%, and minor symptoms in 45% (sense of presence, visual illusions, or passage hallucinations). The prevalence of PDAP was 43% when the usual definition was used (hallucinations and/or delusions) and 60% when the NINDS-NIHM criteria were used. Correlations between PDAP and patient characteristics varied with the definition of PDAP. These findings suggest that the epidemiology of PDAP should be re-evaluated with the new criteria. Minor symptoms and nonvisual hallucinations are an important part of the PDAP spectrum, which has commonly been restricted to visual hallucinations and delusions. <c2><a9> 2010 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - The neural mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia remain essentially unknown. The GABA hypothesis proposes that reduced neuronal GABA concentration and neurotransmission results in cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. However, few in vivo studies have directly examined this hypothesis. We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high field to measure visual cortical GABA levels in 13 subjects with schizophrenia and 13 demographically matched healthy control subjects. We found that the schizophrenia group had an ~10% reduction in GABA concentration. We further tested the GABA hypothesis by examining the relationship between visual cortical GABA levels and orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS), a behavioral measure of visual inhibition thought to be dependent on GABAergic synaptic transmission. Previous work has shown that subjects with schizophrenia exhibit reduced OSSS of contrast discrimination (Yoon et al., 2009). For subjects with both MRS and OSSS data (n = 16), we found a highly significant positive correlation (r = 0.76) between these variables. GABA concentration was not correlated with overall contrast discrimination performance for stimuli without a surround (r = -0.10). These results suggest that a neocortical GABA deficit in subjects with schizophrenia leads to impaired cortical inhibition and that GABAergic synaptic transmission in visual cortex plays a critical role in OSSS.

AB  - Significant data to suggest the need for more appropriate precautions for volunteers participating in stage hypnosis is presented. This paper is a case report of a soldier previously injured in battle who, due to participating in stage hypnosis one year after his injury, experienced a dissociative episode wherein post-traumatic stress symptoms were prominent. During this episode, which lasted over three hours, the service member assaulted an acquaintance, subsequently believed he was a prisoner of war, experienced amnesia for some of the events, and was eventually psychiatrically hospitalized. The diagnosis of acute psychotic reaction was rendered. Fortunately for this service member, upon his return to his treating hospital center, his primary medical team made an appropriate referral. Psychotherapeutic treatment allowed this individual to integrate his traumatic experiences, gain control and understanding of his behavior, and extinguish his pain and suffering, returning to his successful career.

AB  - When non-psychiatric individuals compare the weights of two similar objects of identical mass, but of different sizes, the smaller object is often perceived as substantially heavier. This size-weight illusion (SWI) is thought to be generated by a violation of the common expectation that the large object will be heavier, possibly via a mismatch between an efference copy of the movement and the actual sensory feedback received. As previous research suggests that patients with schizophrenia have deficits in forward model/efference copy mechanisms, we hypothesized that schizophrenic patients would show a reduced SWI. The current study compared the strength of the SWI in schizophrenic patients to matched non-psychiatric participants; weight discrimination for same-sized objects was also assessed. We found a reduced SWI for schizophrenic patients, which resulted in better (more veridical) weight discrimination performance on illusion trials compared to non-psychiatric individuals. This difference in the strength of the SWI persisted when groups were matched for weight discrimination performance. The current findings are consistent with a dysfunctional forward model mechanism in this population. Future studies to elucidate the locus of this impairment using variations on the current study are also proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Smooth pursuit deficits are an intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia that may result from disturbances in visual motion perception, sensorimotor transformation, predictive mechanisms, or alterations in basic oculomotor control. Which of these components are the primary causes of smooth pursuit impairments and whether they are impaired similarly across psychotic disorders remain to be established. Methods: First-episode psychotic patients with bipolar disorder (n = 34), unipolar depression (n = 24), or schizophrenia (n = 77) and matched healthy participants (n = 130) performed three smooth pursuit tasks designed to evaluate different components of pursuit tracking. Results: On ramp tasks, maintenance pursuit velocity was reduced in all three patients groups with psychotic bipolar patients exhibiting the most severe impairments. Open loop pursuit velocity was reduced in psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia patients. Motion perception during pursuit initiation, as indicated by the accuracy of saccades to moving targets, was not impaired in any patient group. Analyses in 138 participants followed for 6 weeks, during which patients were treated and psychotic symptom severity decreased, and no significant change in performance in any group was revealed. Conclusions: Sensorimotor transformation deficits in all patient groups suggest a common alteration in frontostriatal networks that dynamically regulate gain control of pursuit responses using sensory input and feedback about performance. Predictive mechanisms appear to be sufficiently intact to compensate for this deficit across psychotic disorders. The absence of significant changes after acute treatment and symptom reduction suggests that these deficits appear to be stable over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2010
AB  - Psychotic symptoms are frequent and disabling in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methodological issues in the epidemiology of PD associated psychosis (PDP) include differences in the symptoms assessed, the methods of assessment, and the selection of patients. Most studies are prospective clinic-based cross-sectional studies providing point prevalence rates in samples on dopaminergic treatment. Visual hallucinations are present in about one quarter to one third of the patients, auditory in up to 20%. Tactile/somatic, and olfactory hallucinations are usually not systematically sought. Minor phenomena such as sense of presence and visual illusions affect 17 to 72% of the patients, and delusions about 5%. Lifetime prevalence of visual hallucinations reaches approximately 50%. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies suggest that hallucinations persist and worsen in individual patients, and that their prevalence increases with time. A facilitating role of treatment on PDP is demonstrated at least for dopaminergic agonists, but there is no simple dose-effect relationship between dopaminergic treatment and the presence or severity of hallucinations. The main endogenous non-modifiable risk factor is cognitive impairment. Other associated factors include older age/ longer duration of PD, disease severity, altered dream phenomena, daytime somnolence, and possibly depression and dysautonomia. PDP reduces quality of life in patients and increases caregiver distress, and is an independent risk factor for nursing home placement and development of dementia.

AB  - Objective: Fronto-limbic interactions facilitate the generation of task-relevant responses while inhibiting interference from emotionally distracting information. Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in both executive attention and affective regulation. This study aims to elucidate the neural correlates of emotion-attention regulation and shifting in schizophrenia. Method: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe the fronto-limbic regions in 16 adults with schizophrenia and 13 matched adults with no history of psychiatric illness. Subjects performed a forced-choice visual oddball task where they detected infrequent target circles embedded in a series of infrequent non target aversive and neutral pictures and frequent squares. Results: In control participants, target events activated a dorsal frontoparietal network, whereas these regions were deactivated by aversive stimuli. Conversely, ventral fronto-limbic brain regions were activated by aversive stimuli and deactivated by target events. In the patient group, regional hemodynamic time courses revealed not only reduced activation to target and aversive events in dorsal executive and ventral limbic regions, respectively, but also reduced deactivation to target and aversive stimuli in ventral and dorsal regions, respectively, relative to the control group. Patients further showed reduced spatial extent of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus during the target and aversive conditions. Activation of the anterior cingulate to aversive images was inversely related to severity of avolition and anhedonia symptoms in the schizophrenia group. Conclusions: These results suggest both frontal and limbic dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as aberrant reciprocal inhibitions between these regions during attention-emotion modulation in this disorder.

AB  - Deficits in early visual processing are well documented in schizophrenia, using methods such as contrast sensitivity. Higher, integrative stages of functioning, such as susceptibility to visual illusions, have been evaluated less extensively. For example, patients show increased susceptibility to (ie, are more easily affected by) the Muller-Lyer illusion but decreased susceptibility (ie, are less easily affected by) to stereopsis based upon binocular disparity. The basis for pattern of illusion response and interaction between sensory and integrative stages of processing, however, is unclear. We tested a group of 38 patients and 28 control subjects in contrast sensitivity, the Muller-Lyer and Poggendorff illusions, as well as a subgroup in stereopsis and the Ponzo illusion, Sander parallelogram, and Hermann grid illusions. We predicted that patients would be more susceptible to tests that become more apparent with increased contrast (Muller-Lyer illusion), less susceptible to tests that become less apparent with increased contrast (stereopsis, Ponzo illusion, Hermann grid), and equally susceptible to contrast-insensitive tests (Poggendorff illusion). Additionally, the Hermann grid was tested at varying levels of contrast. Patients demonstrated significant deficits in contrast sensitivity, especially to brief, low spatial frequency stimuli, and the predicted differential response to the tested illusions. Additionally, poor performance on stereopsis and the Hermann grid significantly correlated with decreased contrast sensitivity (all P's<.01). Muller-Lyer illusion and stereopsis performance were also inversely related (P<.01). This study replicates and expands upon previous findings with visual illusions. Our results offer a unifying explanation for disparate studies and suggest that deficits in early sensory gain affect subsequent integrative processes.

AB  - Abnormalities of attention and visual perception are well documented in schizophrenia. The global-local task is a measure of attention and perceptual organization that utilizes visual stimuli comprised of large letters (global level) made up of smaller letters (local level). Subjects identify target letters appearing at either the global or local level of the stimulus. In this study, we used a version of the global-local task specifically designed to examine lateralized hemispheric processing and attention shifting in 30 schizophrenia patients and 24 normal controls. Global-local stimuli were presented in couplets (consecutive pairs). Reaction time for the second target in a couplet was compared under conditions in which the target remained at the same level (global-global, local-local) and when the target changed levels (global-local, local-global). Level-specific priming (ie, global to global and local to local) and the local-to-global level shift were similar in both groups. Schizophrenia patients were significantly slower, however, shifting attention from the global to the local level. These results implicate an impairment in shifting attentional resources from predominantly right lateralized magnocellular/dorsal stream processing of global targets to predominantly left lateralized parvocellular/ventral stream processing of local targets. Local interference effects in global processing provide further support for impaired magnocellular processing in schizophrenia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual perception of a stimulus is a function of the visual context in which it is displayed. Surround suppression is a specific form of contextual modulation whereby the perceived contrast of a center stimulus is decreased by a high-contrast surround. Recent studies have demonstrated that individuals with schizophrenia are less prone to visual contextual effects, suggesting impairments in cortical lateral connectivity. We tested whether altered contextual modulation in schizophrenia is stimulus orientation selective. Participants viewed an annulus consisting of contrast-reversing sinusoidal gratings and determined if any one segment of the annulus had lower contrast relative to the other segments. Three stimulus configurations were tested: no surround (NS), parallel surround (PS), and orthogonal surround (OS). In the PS condition, the annulus was embedded in a 100% contrast grating parallel to the annulus gratings. In the OS condition, the surround grating was rotated 90degree relative to the orientation of the annulus gratings. The main dependent measure was the suppression index-the change in contrast threshold in the OS and PS conditions relative to the NS condition. There was a group x condition interaction such that patients had significantly lower PS suppression index than controls, but there were no group differences in the OS suppression index. We conclude that individuals with schizophrenia possess an abnormality in surround suppression that is specific for stimulus orientation. In conjunction with physiological and anatomical evidence from basic and postmortem studies, our results suggest a deficit of inhibition in primary visual cortex in schizophrenia.

AB  - Introduction: Previous studies indicated impaired perceptual organisation in schizophrenia. This study investigated lateral connection and attentional modulation in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. Methods: Contrast threshold was measured for a central Gabor patch, flanked with orthogonal and collinear Gabor patches. In the attended condition, participants performed a concurrent vernier task by determining the spatial offset of the flankers. Results: The controls (n = 25) had lower contrast thresholds in the collinear condition than in the orthogonal condition, whereas the schizophrenia patients (n = 43) did not benefit from the presence of collinear flankers. This deficit was not ameliorated by attentional modulation. Antipsychotic medication did not affect the performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that lateral connections are impaired in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. This deficit cannot be restored by top-down attentional modulation of target-flanker interactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Patients suffering from schizophrenia are less susceptible to various visual illusions. For example, healthy participants perceive a hollow mask as a normal face, presumably due to the strength of constraining top-down influences, while patients with schizophrenia do not (Schneider, U., Leweke, F.M., Sternemann, U., Weber, M.M., Emrich, H.M., 1996. Visual 3D illusion: a systems-theoretical approach to psychosis. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 246, 256-260; Scheider, U., Borsutzky, M., Seifert, J., Leweke, F.M., Huber, T.J., Rollnik J.D., Emrich, H.M., 2002. Reduced binocular depth inversion in schizophrenic patients. Schizophrenia Research 53, 101-108.; Emrich, H.M., Leweke, F.M., Schneider, U., 1997. Towards a cannabinoid hypothesis of schizophrenia: cognitive impairments due to a dysregulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 56, 803-807). However the neural mechanisms underpinning this effect remain poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the hollow-mask illusion in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls. The primary aim of this study was to use measures of effective connectivity arising from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to explain differences in both the perception of the hollow-mask illusion and associated differences in neural responses between patients with schizophrenia and controls, which we hypothesised would be associated with difference in the influences of top-down and bottom-up processes between the groups. Consistent with this explanation, we identified differences between the two groups in effective connectivity. In particular, there was a strengthening of bottom-up processes, and weakening of top-down ones, during the presentation of 'hollow' faces for the patients. In contrast, the controls exhibited a strengthening of top-down processes when perceiving the same stimuli. These findings suggest that schizophrenic patients rely on stimulus-driven processing and are less able to employ conceptually-driven top-down strategies during perception, where incoming sensory data are constrained with reference to a generative model that entails stored information from past experience.

AB  - The third meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) focused on selecting promising measures for each of the cognitive constructs selected in the first CNTRICS meeting. In the domain of perception, the 2 constructs of interest were gain control and visual integration. CNTRICS received 5 task nominations for gain control and three task nominations for visual integration. The breakout group for perception evaluated the degree to which each of these tasks met prespecified criteria. For gain control, the breakout group for perception believed that 2 of the tasks (prepulse inhibition of startle and mismatch negativity) were already mature and in the process of being incorporated into multisite clinical trials. However, the breakout group recommended that steady-state visual evoked potentials be combined with contrast sensitivity to magnocellular vs parvocellular biased stimuli and that this combined task and the contrast-contrast effect task be recommended for translation for use in clinical trial contexts in schizophrenia research. For visual integration, the breakout group recommended the Contour Integration and Coherent Motion tasks for translation for use in clinical trials. This manuscript describes the ways in which each of these tasks met the criteria used by the breakout group to evaluate and recommend tasks for further development.

PY  - 2009
AB  - Objectives: In a recent pilot RCT, looking at the efficacy of body oriented psychological therapy (BPT) in patients with chronic schizophrenia, a marked improvement in negative symptoms was found in the treatment group. To date, there have been no studies to evaluate the therapeutic processes, correlates and predictors of change in-patients receiving BPT. The aims of this study are to address three specific questions, namely how: (1) Ego-pathology and (2) Body experiences, may change during the treatment (BPT). We also looked at: (3) If these pathologies, and/or changes in them, or other characteristics are associated with specific clinical outcomes. Design: Analysis of data obtained within a pilot randomized controlled trial. Method: In a sample of patients with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia, allocated to receive a course of body oriented group psychotherapy, certain parameters were assessed pre- and post-treatment: (1) Ego-pathology, using the ego-pathology inventory (EPI); (2) Body experiences, (size perception/image marking procedure-IMP, body image/body distortion questionnaire-BDQ, and body cathexis/visual-analogue-scales-VAS); and (3) Common symptom factors, using the Positive And Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Subjective experiences were also recorded. Results: Four out of six ego-pathology symptom scores improved over the course of therapy (t = 2.9-3.5, p < .05-.01). Amongst the measures of body experiences, only the body perception indices of the lower extremities changed significantly from underestimation pre-therapy (BPI median 92.3), becoming accurate estimates post therapy (BPI median 101.1). Contrary to the hypothesis a reduction of negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients was not associated with systematic improvements of ego-pathology or body experiences. The strongest predictor of change was a high score of ego-demarcation pre-treatment (beta = 0:89, p < .001). Conclusions: In patients with chronic schizophrenia, body oriented psychological interventions may be effective for both positive therapeutic changes in ego-pathology and negative symptoms, even though these effects are not necessarily related. High scores of ego-pathology at baseline predicted a poor treatment outcome. This finding deserves more systematic studies, as it could potentially identify patients with poorer prognosis and underpin the development of new intervention strategies. Further studies are required to clarify more precisely the exact nature of the processes in BPT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - King, Jelena P

PY  - 2008
AB  - This study frames anomalous functional brain organization in schizophrenia (SCZ) within an evolutionary model of brain development, the dual trends theory (DTT). The DTT argues that neural architecture develops along 2 separate pathways: the dorsal archicortical trend and the ventral paleocortical trend. The DTT dovetails with visual system organization, which is also composed of 2 independent pathways: a dorsal stream dedicated to visuomotor action and a ventral stream dedicated to perceptual processing. The present study examined the integrity of these pathways using a size-contrast visual illusion. Prior research has shown that, normally, perceptual estimations of object size are susceptible to visual illusions, whereas goal-directed actions are resistant. The authors hypothesized that, unlike control participants, SCZ patients' actions would be susceptible to the illusion, reflecting dorsal stream dysfunction. Here, 42 SCZ patients and 42 healthy controls grasped and estimated the size of target blocks in control and illusion conditions. During estimation, both groups were equally perturbed by the illusion; however, grasping movements of patients alone were influenced by the illusion. These results suggest disrupted dorsal brain circuitry in SCZ but relatively intact ventral circuitry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of diaphragmatic myopotential (dMP) oversensing in pacemaker (PM)-dependent patients with CRT-Ds. Methods and Results: We retrospectively evaluated patients with CRT-Ds implanted at our institution between January 2000 and August 2006. PM-dependent patients were identified, and the incidence of inappropriate detections due to dMP oversensing and their possible clinical implications (inappropriate therapies, syncope, and death of any cause) were evaluated. CRT-Ds were implanted in 122 patients, 37 were or became PM dependent. During a mean follow-up of 22 +/- 17 months, 7(18.9%) PM-dependent patients revealed inappropriate detections due to dMP oversensing. All oversensing episodes occurred in CRT-Ds with automatic gain control (AGC) sensing and integrated bipolar (IBP) leads in the RV apex. These detections led to inappropriate shocks in 2(5.4%) patients and syncope in 1(2.7%). Five (13.5%) patients died. Conclusion(s): dMP oversensing in PM-dependent patients with CRT-Ds is an important problem, particularly in CRT-Ds with AGC sensing and IBP leads, with over 20% of patients with these devices revealing inappropriate detections. The clinical impact of dMP oversensing is less marked but relevant, with both inappropriate therapies and syncope occurring in this small group of 37 patients and the possibility of related deaths. <c2><a9> The Author 2008.

AB  - Much work in the cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia has focused on attention, memory, and executive functioning. To date, less work has focused on perceptual processing. However, perceptual functions are frequently disrupted in schizophrenia, and thus this domain has been included in the CNTRICS (Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) project. In this article, we describe the basic science presentation and the breakout group discussion on the topic of perception from the first CNTRICS meeting, held in Bethesda, Maryland on February 26 and 27, 2007. The importance of perceptual dysfunction in schizophrenia, the nature of perceptual abnormalities in this disorder, and the critical need to develop perceptual tests appropriate for future clinical trials were discussed. Although deficits are also seen in auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory processing in schizophrenia, the first CNTRICS meeting focused on visual processing deficits. Key concepts of gain control and integration in visual perception were introduced. Definitions and examples of these concepts are provided in this article. Use of visual gain control and integration fit a number of the criteria suggested by the CNTRICS committee, provide fundamental constructs for understanding the visual system in schizophrenia, and are inclusive of both lower-level and higher-level perceptual deficits.

TI  - Semantic activation and verbal working memory maintenance in schizophrenic thought disorder: Insights from electrophysiology and lexical amibiguity
AU  - Salisbury D.F.
PY  - 2008
AB  - We have examined language processing using ambiguous words (homographs like panel or toast) and rapid or slow presentation rates while recording event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Homographs allow for tracking the train of thought at points of lexical ambiguity and detecting modulation of associative threads by previous context. Rapid presentation rates stress automatic semantic activation, and slow rates stress controlled verbal working memory contextual modulation. In conjunction with reaction times and performance, ERPs allow for objective measurement of activity related to language processing from word presentation through overt behavioral response. Smaller N400 to related and unrelated items at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), the presence of a semantic bias, and large N400 to related and unrelated items at long SOAs are present in schizophrenia. We describe a model of initial semantic memory hyper-priming and subsequent decay of information in verbal working memory stores, the activation-maintenance model of schizophrenic thought disorder hypothesized to underlie the thought disorder in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that spans across biological and behavioral levels. The links between altered neural circuitry and abnormal behaviors are yet to be understood. Visual motion perception has been established in basic neuroscience and may provide an opportunity to link different levels of brain functions in schizophrenia. Center-surround interaction is a ubiquitous neural mechanism underlying the organization of visual information over different spatial locations. Methods: We applied a psychophysical paradigm to examine center-surround interaction in schizophrenia. Patients (n = 24) and control subjects (n = 33) judged the direction of a moving random dot pattern (RDP, center) with and without the presence of another concentric surrounding RDP (surround). Results: The presence of a moving surround shifted the perceptual judgments of center motion in the opposite direction from the surround in both subject groups but the magnitude of the perceptual shift was significantly larger in patients. The increased perceptual shift was not correlated with psychotic symptoms, which were mild in this patient sample, or antipsychotic medication. Conclusions: The increased perceptual shift suggests that the putative surround suppression on visual motion perception is abnormally increased in schizophrenia. This result provides perceptual evidence for altered basic inhibitory control of visual motion context in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pervasive deficits of attention and set switching have been reported in schizophrenia, prompting efforts to identify the information processing mechanisms associated with these deficits. Recent evidence suggests that set switching may be intact in schizophrenia when the task switch requires only a change in the relevance of perceptual dimensions (e.g., attentional set switches) but decision-to-response mappings (intentional set) are maintained across trials in a cued task switching procedure. The goal of the present research was to replicate this finding and to test its direct corollary, which is the unconventional prediction that individuals with schizophrenia will evidence an intact, switch-sensitive P3b brain response to cued switches of attentional set. This prediction was tested in a group of 20 individuals with schizophrenia and 20 healthy comparison participants using event-related brain potential methodology and a cued task-switching task. Attentional set switching costs were equivalent between the two groups despite a set maintenance deficit in schizophrenia. Moreover, a posterior-parietal P3b component of the ERP was found to be equally sensitive to attentional set switching in schizophrenia and comparison groups, indicating a "healthy" brain response to switches of attentional set in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the dynamic control of attentional set may be preserved in schizophrenia and that previously reported executive deficits may be specific to the control of intentional task set and to deficits of task set maintenance.

AB  - This study examined gestalt perception in high-functioning autism (HFA) and its relation to tasks indicative of local visual processing. Data on of gestalt perception, visual illusions (VI), hierarchical letters (HL), Block Design (BD) and the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) were collected in adult males with HFA, schizophrenia, depression and normative controls. Individuals with HFA processed gestalt stimuli less in accord with gestalt laws, particularly regarding the principle of similarity. Gestalt processing correlated positively with global processing of the HL. EFT and BD performance correlated negatively with VI susceptibility in HFA. All clinical groups succumbed less to VI than the normative sample. Results suggest decreased gestalt perception in HFA, being associated with a more general local visual processing bias.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Introduction: A series of studies have suggested that schizophrenia patients are deficient in theory of mind (ToM). However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying ToM deficits in schizophrenia are largely unknown. The present study examined the hypothesis that impaired ToM in schizophrenia can be understood as a deficit in context processing. Methods: Disorganised schizophrenia patients (N = 12), nondisorganised schizophrenia patients (N = 36), and nonpsychotic psychiatric patients (N = 26) were tested on three ToM tasks and a visual size perception task, a measure of perceptual context processing. In addition, statistical analyses were carried out which compared chronic, treatment-refractory schizophrenia patients (N = 28) to those with an episodic course of illness (N = 20). Results: Overall, ToM performance was linked to deficits in context processing in schizophrenia patients. Statistical comparisons showed that disorganised as well as chronic schizophrenia patients were more impaired in ToM but more accurate in a visual size perception task where perceptual context is misleading. Conclusions: This pattern of results is interpreted as indicating a possible link between deficits in ToM and perceptual context processing, which together with deficits in perceptual grouping, are part of a broader dysfunction in cognitive coordination in schizophrenia.

AB  - Developments in the fields of science and technology have revolutionized Human Life at material level. But in actuality, this progress is only superficial: underneath modern men and women are living in conditions of great mental and emotional stress, even in developed and affluent countries. People from all over the world irrespective of culture and economic background suffer from mental illness and though a number of researches are carried out worldwide but till date it has not been possible to resolve the problem. In today's world stress is increasing everyday. The individualistic approach towards life; the neonatal family system has increased the burden even further. Without adequate support system of friends and relatives--people are falling prey to mental illness. The insecurities, the inferiority feelings of these persons lead to disruption of communication between the sufferer and the family members and friends. The sufferers prefer to confine themselves within the four walls of their home and remain withdrawn from the whole world. They prefer to stay in touch with their world of fantasy--far away from the world of reality. Disability caused by some of the mental illnesses often remains invisible to the society leading to lack of support system and facilities for them. These unfortunate disabled persons not only need medication and counseling but a thorough rehabilitation programme to bring them back to the main stream of life. The task being not an easy one. According to the research works these persons need some work and income to improve their quality of life. In this scenario where society is adverse towards them, where stigma towards mental illness prevails; where help from friends and community is not available- training them in computer and forming groups through computer was thought to be an ideal option for the solution- a solution to the problems of modern life through modern technology. * It was seen that this insecure disabled persons feel free to experiment with machine more easily than with society and people. * Computer provides them the needed education and information needed for their further developments. * Computers provide them facilities to interact with others and form self-help groups. * Computers also enabled them to earn their livelihood. Thus this modern gadget, which is sometimes believed to make a man loner, has been actually acting as the bridge between the persons suffering from mental illness to the society in general. The disabled person also gains confidence and courage as they gain control over the machine. Gaining control over the machine helps them to gain control over their life. The product of Science and technology has been seen to revolutionized Human Life not only in material level but also on personal level- helping the disabled to gain control over their lives.

AB  - Schizophrenia is often accompanied by a range of visual perception deficits, with many involving impairments in motion perception. The presence of perceptual abnormalities may impair neural processes that depend on normal visual analysis, which in turn may affect overall functioning in dynamic visual environments. Here, we examine the integrity of suppressive center-surround mechanisms in motion perception of schizophrenic patients. Center-surround suppression has been implicated in a range of visual functions, including figure-ground segregation and pursuit eye movements, visual functions that are impaired in schizophrenia. In control subjects, evidence of center-surround suppression is found in a reduced ability to perceive motion of a high-contrast stimulus as its size increases. This counterintuitive finding is likely a perceptual correlate of center-surround mechanisms in cortical area MT. We now show that schizophrenic patients exhibit abnormally weak center-surround suppression in motion, an abnormality that is most pronounced in patients with severe negative symptoms. Interestingly, patients with the weakest surround suppression outperformed control subjects in motion discriminations of large high-contrast stimuli. This enhanced motion perception of large high-contrast stimuli is consistent with an MT abnormality in schizophrenia and has a potential to disrupt smooth pursuit eye movements and other visual functions that depend on unimpaired center-surround interactions in motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary purpose of this investigation was to assess the neural correlates of implicit cueing during an inhibitory task in schizophrenia when performance accuracy was matched with healthy comparison subjects., METHODS: We compared 17 individuals with chronic schizophrenia (SZ; medicated, 13.9 average years of illness) and 17 healthy comparison subjects (HC) matched for hit and false alarm rates, age, and education on a visual Go/Nogo task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this task, one of the go stimuli also served implicitly as a cue predictive of a subsequent inhibitory (Nogo) trial., CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that even when matched for overall performance accuracy, individuals with SZ exhibit difficulties with inhibition and cue processing that may relate to core deficits in cognitive control and stimulus processing. In particular, these findings point towards an important role of the parietal cortex for cued inhibitory processes in healthy populations.

AB  - This study assesses the efficacy of an educational and dietary approach in preventing olanzapine-induced weight gain. Eighteen patients affected by schizophrenic disorders were treated with olanzapine and weighed twice-weekly for 24 weeks. A psychoeducational intervention and referral to a nutritionist was introduced from the beginning of olanzapine treatment in 9 patients, and from the 9th week of therapy in 8 patients. Results showed that after 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment, weight gain was contained in the subjects receiving intervention unlike patients without preventive intervention (+0.99+/-3.34 kg vs. +2.96+/-3.08 kg; p <.03). At the end of the trial these patients partly shed their gain (-1.77 kg), presenting a final weight which was not significantly different from baseline (+1.19 kg). Subjects receiving the psychoeducational approach from the beginning were significantly heavier than at baseline (+3.4 kg). Poor dietary compliance correlated significantly with an increase in body weight, while higher mean dosages of olanzapine correlated with better weight-gain control.

PY  - 2005
AB  - Objective: The authors tested whether decisions about incongruencies in the representation and processing of semantic knowledge, thought to be related to cognitive control, are selectively impaired in schizophrenia. Method: Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy comparison subjects determined the relative size of paired stimuli as they are in the real world. Stimuli were words or images. Real-world "distance" (size difference between stimuli) was manipulated within pairs, as was "congruency" between real-world and presentation size. Results: Although patients were slower overall, both groups exhibited similar effects of "distance" and "congruency"; the task was easier when the real-world size difference between stimuli was greater and when stimuli were congruent in presentation and real-world size. Conclusions: Some aspects of the representation of semantic knowledge are preserved in schizophrenia, and patients use this information to control cognition in the same manner as healthy individuals.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is associated with perceptual organization deficits and abnormal neuronal connectivity has been described in early visual areas. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional integrity of lateral connections in early visual areas of patients with schizophrenia and type I bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis. Method: Twenty-four out-patients with schizophrenia, 22 out-patients with bipolar disorder, and 20 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Using a computer-assisted psychophysical test, contrast thresholds were measured for centrally presented target stimuli (Gabor patches), which were surrounded by two collinear flankers. Target-to-flanker distances were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 12lambda. Psychophysical measures were contrast threshold changes at each target-to-flanker distance compared with baseline thresholds determined for isolated targets with no flankers. Clinical measures included IQ, positive, negative, and depressive symptoms. Results: In patients with schizophrenia, flankers did not facilitate contrast detection for target stimuli at 2-6lambda distances compared to controls [effect size (Cohen's d): 1-25-1-42]. The inhibitory effect of flankers (0 and 1lambda) and contrast thresholds in the absence of flankers were spared. Patients with bipolar disorder did not differ from the controls. Medicated and non-medicated patients displayed similar performances. Positive and negative symptoms and depression did not correlate with contrast threshold values. Conclusions: Excitatory lateral connections in early visual cortex are specifically impaired in patients with schizophrenia, which may contribute to perceptual disorders such as unclear seeing, partial or skewed sight, disrupted rectilinearity, and abnormal figure-ground segregation.

AB  - Visual context processing was examined in relation to schizotypy in a large nonclinical university population. Schizotypal status was assessed with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). Schizotypal (n = 32) and non-schizotypal (n = 37) subjects were tested on a contour integration task (where context processing is necessary for good performance) and a visual size perception task (where context processing impairs accurate performance). In addition, a short form of the Thought Disorder Index (TDI) was administered to 28 schizotypal subjects. Thought disordered Schizotypal subjects showed significantly impaired performance on the contour integration task but more accurate performance on the visual size perception task. These results support the hypothesis that deficits in visual context processing are the manifestation of a larger disturbance of cognitive coordination in schizotypy and schizophrenia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate lateral connectivity in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. Contrast thresholds were measured for centrally presented Gabor patches which were surrounded by two collinear or orthogonal flankers. The healthy subjects (n=15) showed lower contrast thresholds for central Gabor patches when collinear flankers were presented. This effect was significantly reduced in unmedicated highly functioning schizophrenia patients (n=20) who performed normally on the continuous performance test. The performance of the patients did not correlate with the positive and negative symptoms. The facilitation effect of collinear flankers is believed to reflect lateral interactions between feature-specific units in early visual cortex (V1). Our results therefore suggest abnormal lateral interactions in early visual cortex of schizophrenia patients. <c2><a9> 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Experiment 1 measured contrast sensitivity for stationary and counterphase-modulated sinusoidal gratings at four spatial (0.5, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 cycles/degree) and four temporal frequencies (0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0 Hz). The results showed that there were no differences in spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity between the control and positive-symptom group, and in comparison with these groups, contrast sensitivity was significantly lower at all spatial and temporal frequencies in the negative-symptom group. Experiment 2 measured the visibility of a Landolt C target with a constant target stimulus duration of 4.0 ms followed by a 150-ms backward mask, which was presented at 12 stimulus onset asynchronies from 0 to 110 ms in the same groups of observers. Consistent with the findings of the previous experiment, there were no significant differences in backward masking between the control and positive-symptom group, and in comparison with these groups, visual backward masking was significantly higher at all stimulus onset asynchronies from 40 to 110 ms in the negative-symptom group. The present findings show that there were no significant differences in contrast sensitivity and in backward masking between normal observers and a group with positive symptoms in schizophrenia. It was concluded that the reduction in contrast sensitivity for low spatial frequency counterphase flicker in the negative-symptom group is consistent with a reduction in the 'contrast gain control' mechanism of magnocellular channels, and that the reduction in contrast sensitivity for medium and high stationary gratings is consistent with a disorder in parvocellular channels. It was proposed that a disorder in magnocellular channels in the negative-symptom group may enforce a reliance on parvocellular channels that results in longer temporal summation and visible persistence, slower visual processing of single target stimuli at threshold and higher levels of sensory integration, and backward masking when multiple stimuli are presented rapidly in time. <c2><a9> Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Previously the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine was shown to disrupt generation of the auditory event-related potential (FRP) mismatch negativity (MMN) and the performance of an AX-type continuous performance test (AX-CPT)--measures of auditory and visual context-dependent information processing--in a similar manner as observed in schizophrenia. This placebo-controlled study investigated effects of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin on the same measures in 18 healthy volunteers (10 men, 8 women; mean age 25.1 yrs). Psilocybin administration induced significant performance deficits in the AX-CPT, but failed to reduce MMN generation significantly. These results indirectly support evidence that deficient MMN generation in schizophrenia may be a relatively distinct manifestation of deficient NMDAR functioning. In contrast, secondary pharmacological effects shared by NMDAR antagonists and the 5-HT2A agonist (i.e., disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission) may be the mechanism underlying impairments in AX-CPT performance observed during both psilocybin and ketamine administration. Comparable deficits in schizophrenia may result from independent dysfunctions of 5-HT2A and NMDAR-related neurotransmission. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Respirophasic Noise Transients in ICD Patients. Introduction: Ventricular oversensing (OS) of respirophasic noise transients may cause spurious detections and therapies and pacing inhibition among patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators-(ICDs). The incidence of OS and its relationship to clinical variables and ICD system design are unknown. Methods and Results: Three hundred twenty-nine patients performed provocative respiratory maneuvers at rest during intrinsic rhythm and continuous ventricular pacing. OS resulting in spurious ventricular detections was provoked in 3 (0.9%) of 329 patients during intrinsic rhythm and 34 (10.3%) of 329 during pacing. Noise transients not recognized and marked as sensed events, but visually evident on the local endocardial ventricular electrogram, were provoked in an additional 23 (7.0%) of 329 patients. Multivariate logistic regression identified history of spontaneous OS (P < 0.0005, odds ratio 9.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 50.0), automatic gain control device (P < 0.0005, odds ratio 5.3, 95% CI 2.6 to 10.8) or integrated bipolar lead (P = 0.05, odds ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.25), and male gender (P = 0.008, odds ratio 3.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.1) as predictive of provocable OS. Spontaneous OS resulting in spurious ventricular detections and therapies occurred in 12 (3.6%) patients during follow-up. Eleven of 12 spontaneous episodes occurred in male patients during ventricular pacing; 11 of 12 patients had automatic gain control devices and integrated bipolar leads. Conclusion(s): OS is commonly provoked in ICD patients during ventricular pacing and may occur spontaneously, causing spurious tachyarrhythmia therapies and pacing inhibition. Differences in the incidence of spontaneous and provoked OS between ICD systems can be explained on the basis of unique features of automatic sensing systems and sensing lead design.

AB  - Established the specificity of body image pathology in patients with schizophrenia, its changes during acute treatment, and its association with other symptom factors. Cognitive, affective, and perceptual facets of body image and psychopathology were assessed in 60 inpatients with paranoid schizophrenia, 19 with schizoaffective disorder, 40 with depressive disorder, and 28 with anxiety disorders at admission, and after 2 and 4 wks of treatment. Body size perception was also assessed in 44 healthy adults. Ss with paranoid schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders showed underestimation of lower extremities at each time point. They expressed a higher degree of body concept disturbances at admission, but not at later stages. In a factor analysis, body perception and body concept loaded on distinct factors, which were separate from positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and anxiety.

AB  - AIMS: In newer implantable cardioverter-defibrillators with automatic gain control amplifiers the maximum possible sensitivity is programmed with the aim of securing optimal detection of ventricular fibrillation. This study was designed to prove that a reduction in maximum sensitivity is safe with respect to appropriate sensing of ventricular fibrillation, while avoiding sensing of extracardiac signals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two consecutive patients, undergoing defibrillator implantation/replacement with programmable maximum auto-gain sensing sensitivity (Ventak Mini III, Ventak AV , Guidant, St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.), were prospectively investigated. Thirty-four patients were implanted with a dual-coil lead system, providing integrated bipolar sensing (Endotak, Guidant, St. Paul, MN, U.S.A.), eight patients received a single-coil lead system with true bipolar sensing (Sprint, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.). During device implantation and pre-discharge testing, arrhythmia detection times of induced ventricular fibrillation were compared at programmed maximum (0.18 mV) and minimum (0.43 mV) sensitivity in a randomized manner. Seventy-six induced episodes of ventricular fibrillation were analysed. The mean arrhythmia detection times did not differ between the programmed sensing levels (maximum sensitivity: 1612 +/- 307 ms, vs minimal sensitivity: 1,602 +/- 330 ms; P = ns). The results were not affected by the type of implanted lead system (integrated bipolar versus true bipolar sensing). CONCLUSION(S): In the implantable defibrillator devices, reduction in maximum sensitivity did not impair the detection of induced episodes of ventricular fibrillation.

AB  - Background: In patients with schizophrenia, deficient generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) - An event-related potential (ERP) indexing auditory sensory ('echoic') memory - And a selective increase of 'context dependent' ('CBX') errors in the 'A-X' version of the Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) indicate an impaired ability to form and use transient memory traces. Animal and human studies implicate deficient N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functioning in such abnormalities. In this study, effects of the NMDAR antagonists ketamine on MMN generation and AX-CPT performance were investigated in healthy volunteers to test the hypothesis that NMDARs are critically involved in human MMN generation, and to assess the nature of ketamine-induced deficits in AX-CPT performance. Method(s): In a single-blind placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy volunteers underwent an infusion with subanesthetic doses of ketamine. The MMN-to-pitch and MMN-to-duration deviants were obtained while subjects performed an AX-CPT. Result(s): Ketamine significantly decreased the peak amplitudes of the MMN-to-pitch and MMN-to-duration deviants by 27% and 21%, respectively. It induced performance deficits in the AX-CPT characterized by decreased hit rates and specific increases of errors (BX errors), reflecting a failure to form and use transient memory traces of task relevant information. Conclusion(s): The NMDARs are critically involved in human MMN generation. Deficient MMN in schizophrenia thus suggests deficits in NMDAR-related neurotransmission. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dysfunction may also contribute to the impairment of patients with schizophrenia in forming and using transient memory traces in more complex tasks, such as the AX-CPT. Thus, NMDAR-related dysfunction may underlie deficits in transient memory at different levels of information processing in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: Brain mechanisms underlying deficits in precision of transient memory storage in schizophrenia were investigated using a combined behavioral and event-related potential approach. Performance was measured simultaneously in 2 tasks: an AX-type visual continuous performance test (AX-CPT), which required subjects to press a button whenever they saw a letter A followed by a letter X, and a mismatch negativity paradigm. The AX-CPT is designed to assess prefrontal function, whereas mismatch negativity assesses functioning of the auditory sensory memory system. Method(s): Subjects were 17 patients with chronic schizophrenia, 13 with recent-onset schizophrenia, and 20 normal comparison subjects. Potentials were recorded from 36 scalp locations in response to cue stimuli in the CPT and to duration- and pitch-deviant stimuli in the mismatch negativity paradigm. Behavioral measures including responses to incorrect cue-target sequences that should have been ignored ('false alarms') were analyzed as a function of cue-target interval. Result(s): Chronic and recent-onset schizophrenic patients showed significantly decreased mismatch negativity amplirude but normal latency and topography. In the CPT, patients showed significantly higher rates of false alarms following incorrect cues ('BX' errors) and decreased rates of correct detections. Impaired performance correlated with decreased frontocentral event-related potential activation to incorrect cues that was manifest within several hundred milliseconds of cue presentation. All groups performed worse with increasing cue-target intervals. Patients were no more affected by increased cue-target interval than were controls. Conclusion(s): Schizophrenic patients are significantly impaired in their ability to form and utilize transient memory traces to guide behavior. These deficits are associated with failures of cortical activation occurring within several hundred milliseconds of stimulus presentation. A similar pattern of deficit is observed across sensory and cognitive systems.

AU  - Annandale J.B.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Background: Previous reports document visual illusions resembling hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) after risperidone treatment in patients with histories of previous LSD exposure. Method(s): We report a case with visual disturbances resembling HPPD after each of three consecutive risperidone dose increases. Result(s): Contrasting with previous reports, our patient lacked any history of substance abuse, particularly hallucinogen exposure. She lacked neurologic or other contributory illnesses. Illusions generally remitted within 48 hours each time. Coadministration of trazodone and clonazepam may have contributed to these phenomena, although clonazepam has been used to treat this condition. She had been unusually sensitive to the side-effects of many psychotropics. Conclusion(s): This case is unique due to the absence of substance abuse. This and another report note heightened sensitivity to medication side-effects. Visual phenomena resembling HPPD evidently can occur with risperidone and, possibly, other atypical antipsychotics and certain antidepressants regardless of previous hallucinogen use. Several lines of evidence implicate reduced 5HT2a serotonin receptor stimulation rather than increased 5HT2c stimulation.

AU  - Kopp, Bruno
AU  - Rist, Fred
PY  - 1999
AB  - Response monitoring in schizophrenic patients and healthy controls was assessed by measuring performance and event-related brain potentials in the flanker priming task. Three visual-context conditions were construed: Flankers and targets pointed either into the same direction or into different directions. Stimuli without any response assignment were used as flankers in the neutral context condition. The schizophrenic patients were further subdivided into paranoid (n = 19) and nonparanoid (n = 10) patients and compared with healthy controls (n = 18). Performance scores revealed that the flankers induced a similar degree of distraction by visual context in all 3 groups. Although the schizophrenic patients showed normal error correction performance, the error negativity (NE) was significantly reduced in paranoid schizophrenic patients. The attenuation of the NE possibly reflects disturbed response monitoring in these patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Trabert W.
PY  - 1999
AB  - Delusional parasitosis (DP) is associated in 5-15% with shared psychotic disorder (SPD). Little systematic information is available about this particular aspect of the syndrome. A thorough review of all published cases with DP was carried out. 68 case histories of SPD were identified (5.67%). The data of these patients were compared with those of their inducers (n = 44) and with the data of DP patients, who did not transfer their delusional beliefs to others (n = 1,155). Approximately 30% of the psychotic dyads were reported from public health departments. The sex ratio was balanced in the SPD group, but showed a clear preponderance of females in the other two groups. SPD patients and their inducers reported more frequently visual illusions or hallucinations and located the animals correspondingly upon the surface of the skin. No diagnostic differences were found between the inducers and those who had DP but did not induce SPD in others. Albeit 50% of the SPD patients did not receive any treatment except separation from the inducer, the remission rate in this group was 93%.

PY  - 1998
AB  - Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two distinct categories of mental disorders in the DSM-IV. However, it is often difficult to make a differential diagnosis because of the overlapping symptoms. A potential adjunct in the classification of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is the application of information processing models, as patients with schizophrenia and possibly those with bipolar disorder have information processing deficits. A study was conducted in which a computerized battery of information processing tasks (called COGLAB) was administered to three participant groups: patients with schizophrenia, patients with bipolar disorder, and normal controls. The tasks included the Mueller-Lyer illusion, reaction time, size estimation, a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, backward masking, and Asarnow continuous performance. Discriminant analyses were used to investigate the differences among the three groups. Results indicated that COGLAB correctly classified 75.5% of the cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Mueller-Lyer illusion and the number of perseverative errors on the card sort most powerfully discriminated the two groups.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests the presence of a lateralizing attentional deficit in schizophrenia. In the present study, 23 unmedicated patients with schizophrenia (mean age = 32.1 years) and 14 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were studied with the Global/Local Task to provide converging evidence for the presence of a left-hemisphere-associated attentional deficit in schizophrenia. This task is sensitive to the integrity of mechanisms involved in discriminating local and global elements of stimuli. Previous research has linked the discrimination of local targets to left hemispheric processes and the discrimination of global targets to right hemispheric processes. As predicted, patients were impaired in the detection of local level targets, consistent with a left hemispheric deficit. The degree of impairment correlated with the patient's level of auditory hallucinations. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an asymmetrical attentional deficit in schizophrenia and left hemispheric dysfunction. The correlation between this deficit and auditory hallucinations is consistent with a hypothesized relationship between this symptom in schizophrenia and left temporal pathology.

PY  - 1994
AB  - BACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy') has become one of the most widely used illicit substances in the UK. Little is known of the psychiatric morbidity which may be associated with its use. We have examined this association by collecting a series of psychiatric cases in which MDMA use was a prominent feature., METHOD: Patients presenting between 1990 and 1992 with psychiatric symptoms which developed in the context of MDMA use (n = 13) were interviewed, and their psychiatric, medical and drug history, sociodemographic background and mental state were examined in detail. The psychopathology of cases with psychosis (n = 8) was assessed with the Present State Examination and compared with that of substance-naive psychotic controls (n = 40)., RESULTS: Eight patients presented with psychotic syndromes, two experienced visual illusions, hallucinations and palinopsia, one had panic attacks, one suffered from depression, and one described chronic depersonalisation and derealisation. The psychopathology of the patients with psychoses was very similar to that of controls., CONCLUSIONS: Use of MDMA may be associated with a broader spectrum of psychiatric morbidity than heretofore suspected. Cases with psychosis may be clinically similar to psychotic patients with no history of substance use.

AB  - Used a size estimation (SE) paradigm and the Mueller-Lyer (ML) illusion to examine perceptual disturbances in schizophrenics. 35 schizophrenic Ss (mean age 31.9 yrs) were compared to 20 Ss with no history of psychiatric illness. Perceptual distortions found in previous studies of schizophrenics were only confirmed to a certain extent in the present results. More overestimators were found among the schizophrenic Ss than among the normal Ss on the SE task. The schizophrenic Ss, especially the chronic Ss, also proved to be more prone to the ML illusion. A reason why the very clear differences between schizophrenic Ss and normal Ss found in previous examinations were not confirmed in the present study might be that a reliable diagnostic instrument was used for the 1st time in this kind of study.

AB  - Visual distractibility was studied in schizophrenic patients. Subjects had to respond to target stimuli while they ignored the visual context, which was either congruent, neutral, or incongruent with respect to the target stimulus. Eighteen schizophrenic patients and 18 healthy subjects performed this flanker task. Schizophrenic patients did not show increased distractibility compared with healthy subjects, and both groups showed the same attenuation of visual context effects when the spatial distance between target and flanker stimuli was increased. The two groups showed the same amount of interference by incongruent visual context. Thus, schizophrenic patients did not show enhanced distractibility, spatial extension of attention, or response competition. When flanker and target stimuli were redundant, the responses of schizophrenic patients were less accelerated than those of healthy subjects.

TI  - Priming effects in schizophrenia: Associative interference and facilitation as a function of visual context
AU  - Elkins, Irene J
AU  - Cromwell, Rue L
PY  - 1994
AB  - Irrelevant stimuli that flank a fixated target may cause either facilitation or interference with target classification. 20 schizophrenic patients, 20 depressed control patients, and 20 normal control Ss were compared on a flanker priming task that involved the linear display of a target surrounded by 2 flanking letters or digits. Choice %RT% between letter and digit targets was examined as a function of flanker condition and onset asynchrony between flankers and target. Facilitative priming occurred only with prior exposure of flankers compatible with the response required and was greater in degree with schizophrenic and depressed than with normal Ss. Interference from flankers incompatible with the response required occurred less among schizophrenics than among other groups. Several different processes may be involved in the inhibition of irrelevant information by schizophrenics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Generality in the errors of estimation of body image
AU  - Hundleby, J D
AU  - Bourgouin, N C
PY  - 1993
AB  - An aspect of the considerable research on the association between eating disorders and discrepancies in body image estimation is the extent, if at all, that such discrepancies could be due to a more general tendency to show a positive or negative bias in estimation of the size of objects. One hundred female subjects, without known eating disorder, estimated the width of their own bodies (head, shoulders, waist, and hips), of another person's body (waist and hips), of four commercial packages, and of a cylinder. Errors in estimation, computed as algebraic differences from the true value, were computed, and all error means were found to be positive. Correlations between the error scores were all positive. Factor analysis of the correlations between the 11 error scores indicated a substantial general factor plus a bipolar factor, or alternatively two positively correlated factors referring to human body or physical measures. Results were interpreted as supporting the notion of a broad general tendency to enhance or diminish estimations of the width of familiar objects including estimations of the width of own body parts. The relevance of this finding to eating disorders was discussed.

PY  - 1992
AB  - Bupropion hydrochloride is a phenylaminoketone antidepressant whose clinical pharmacology is poorly understood. Part of bupropion's action may be attributed to inhibition of dopamine reuptake that may induce organic mental disorders in certain susceptible patients. We report three cases of organic mental disorders in patients receiving bupropion hydrochloride for treatment of the depressed phase of their bipolar-type mood instability. The organic mental disorders that occurred in these patients were characterized largely by visual disturbances-visual hallucinations and visual illusions-although one patient also experienced auditory hallucinations. The patients' use of concomitant medications and potential drug interactions are carefully evaluated and the literature on bupropion's ability to induce organic mental disorders is reviewed. We suggest a number of possible mediating mechanisms for these syndromes including dose-related dopaminergic augmentation, accumulation of toxic metabolites, predisposition to psychosis, and drug interactions.

The bizarre feelings about the images of body and objects are called the 'Alice in Wonderland syndrome' due to the similarity with Alice's dreams. The same symptomatology including visual metamorphosia is defined in patients with migraine, epilepsy, intoxication due to hallucinogenic drugs, schizophrenia, hyperpyrexia, and cerebral lesions. Alice in Wonderland syndrome has also been reported in the course of IM.

TI  - Simulated bipolar cells in fovea of human retina. I. Computer simulation
AU  - Siminoff, R
PY  - 1991
AB  - This static bipolar cell (BC) model of the human fovea is based on a number of reasonable assumptions. The human fovea is directly responsible for visual acuity and color vision. The fovea can be considered as having two parts; a central fovea with only red- and green-sensitive cones and a parafovea with blue-sensitive cones added to the other two. A cone mosaic can be precisely organized spatially into unit hexagons that specify inputs to horizontal cells (HC) and BCs. The retina up to and including BCs is piece-wise linear, i.e. at a given steady-state adapting light intensity BC outputs are linear functions of the physical image. BC centers receive inputs directly from weighted cones, while antagonistic surrounds receive inverted inputs from HCs. Appropriate optical and chromatic filtering due to the eye that are taken from human data are incorporated into the model. Chromatic aberrations are simulated by three separate point spread functions that also are taken from human data. Automatic gain control of cones is a function of intensity and wavelength of the steady adapting light.

TI  - Simulated bipolar cells in fovea of human retina. VI. Wavelength discrimination
AU  - Siminoff R.
PY  - 1991
AB  - A computer model of simulated bipolar cells (BC) in the human retina is used to study wavelength discrimination (lambda delta). lambda delta curves are obtained for the two C-types of BCs in the central fovea and the three C-type BCs of the parafovea under various conditions. For the parafovea algebraic addition of the three C-type BCs with proper weighting of the blue-center BC, such that the unique orange locus = 600 nm, gives a combined channel whose lambda delta curve agrees remarkably well with those found in the literature based on human and primate psychophysics. Other studies include effects of chromatic adaptation and dispersion on lambda delta. From this and earlier studies it can be concluded that the center/surround organization of the BCs optimize resolution in the presence of natural occurring dispersion; in addition a specific BC receptive field organization could be picked as being optimal.

PY  - 1988
AB  - The organization of the rod spherule and of the horizontal cell axon terminals within the invagination of the rod spherule in the human retina was examined in serial sections by electron microscopy. Twenty-one rod spherules were reconstructed in this study. Axon terminal processes of type I horizontal cells consistently make one or two small punctate synapses onto each rod spherule within the invagination. In addition, these axon terminal processes make distinct synapses upon rod bipolar dendrites outside the spherule before both processes enter the invagination. This is the first positive description of a synapse from a horizontal cell axon terminal process onto a photoreceptor terminal and the first identification of a synapse from a horizontal cell to a rod bipolar cell in the mammalian outer plexiform layer. We speculate that the axon terminal-to-rod synapse is responsible for feedback while the synapse upon the rod bipolar cell is feed-forward and serves to expand the receptive field of the rod bipolar cell beyond its dendritic field. Alternatively, the latter may contribute to a center-surround organization of the rod bipolar's receptive field.

AU  - Breslow, L
AU  - Cowan, P A
PY  - 1984
AB  - This study describes a strategy for examining cognitive functioning in psychotic and normal children without the usual confounding effects of marked differences in cognitive structure that occur when children of the same age are compared. Participants were 14 psychotic children, 12 males and 2 females, mean age 9-2, matched with normal children at preoperational and concrete operational stage levels on a set of Piagetian classification tasks. The mean age of the normal children was 6-4, replicating the usually found developmental delay in psychotic samples. Participants were then compared on both structural level and functional abilities on a set of tasks involving seriation of sticks; the higher-level children were also administered a seriation drawing task. Analysis of children's processes of seriating and seriation drawings indicated that over and above the structural retardation, psychotic children at all levels showed functional deficits, especially in the use of anticipatory imagery. The implications for general developmental theory are that progress in structural development is not sufficient for imaginal development, and that structural development of logical concepts is relatively independent of the development of imagery. It was suggested that "thought disorder" may not be a disordered structure of thinking or a retardation in psychotic populations but rather a mismatch between higher-level logical structures and lower-level functions.

AU  - Siminoff, R
PY  - 1984
AB  - Two classes of amacrine cells are simulated, small-field and large-field. Small-field amacrine cells are formed by input from a single bipolar cell, while large-field amacrine cell is formed by inputs from same 7 bipolar cells that form the ganglion cell. Only tonic amacrine cells are studied with both chromatic and luminosity types as well as double- and single-opponent receptive fields. Amacrine cells are used in both feedforward to ganglion cells and feedback to bipolar and horizontal cells. Feedback to bipolar cells or feedforward to ganglion cells affected steady state levels in a predictable fashion. Negative feedback to bipolar cells and positive feedforward to ganglion cells does not introduce transients to ganglion cells while negative feedback to horizontal cells and negative feedforward does. Feedback to horizontal cells produces complex effects on bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells dependent on such factors as center-surround field balance and negative feedback from luminosity type of horizontal cell to cones.

AB  - Imagery and verbal aspects of schizophrenic informational performance were examined. Pictorially and verbally presented pairs of items were compared with respect to both pronounceability of their names and their real-life sizes. Results indicated slower stimulus encoding of pictorial than verbal stimulation among the schizophrenics, especially paranoids. On the other hand, comparison of item properties appeared intact regardless of stimulus-presentation format. Non-paranoids made fewer errors as size judgements became more difficult, suggesting protection against erroneously stating the presence of stimulus properties. Scores from a questionnaire directed toward habitual use of imagery and verbal processes indicated significantly greater preference for the latter among paranoids.

AB  - The first-generation automatic implantable defibrillator implanted in man sensed arrhythmias by monitoring a transcardiac electrocardiographic signal. This sensing system reliably detected ventricular fibrillation and sinusoidal ventricular tachycardia but failed to sense all nonsinusoidal ventricular tachycardias. To solve this problem, a new ventricular tachycardia detection scheme was developed using a local ventricular bipolar electrogram and electronic circuits using rate averaging and automatic gain control to permit sensing of electrograms down to 0.1 mV. This detection scheme was tested during electrophysiologic studies in 11 patients with ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. All 22 episodes of induced ventricular tachycardia with a rate above the selected cutoff were detected after an average of 5.1 +/- 1.8 seconds. No episodes below the rate cutoff were detected. The bipolar circuits also reliably detected ventricular fibrillation. Arrhythmia detection and signal quality in 9 patients receiving automatic defibrillators using the new bipolar rate detection circuit were compared with the findings in 5 patients previously receiving units that sensed arrhythmias using the transcardiac electrocardiographic signal. Compared with the transcardiac monitoring units the newer bipolar units had shorter and more uniform sense times (5.5 +/- 1.4 versus 12.2 +/- 7.1 seconds). It is concluded that malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias can be sensed accurately using bipolar rate detection and that this system has numerous advantages over the previously used transcardiac electrocardiographic signal.

The subjects had to classify the widths of a sequence of rectangles into one of four categories while ignoring their height. Each response was timed. Although all the patients performed the task more slowly than their appropriate control group, the results showed that schizophrenic patients integrated these simple stimuli just as do normal subjects. Thus failure of simple stimulus integration is not a feature of schizophrenia.

PY  - 1980
AB  - Investigated the perception by 54 schizophrenic patients and controls (aged 21-70 yrs) of stimuli with more than 1 feature (dimension). Indices of the ability (a) to make use of redundant stimulus cues, (b) to filter irrelevant stimulus features, and (c) to scan the perceptual field for relevant stimulus features, indicate that only filtering was consistently poor in schizophrenia. It has been suggested that schizophrenic patients may tend to perceive their environment in an undifferentiated holistic manner rather than in an analytic manner and the implication for the theory of left hemisphere pathology in schizophrenia is discussed. However, the performance of the schizophrenic Ss did not differ significantly from that of the control group of depressed patients, which suggests that the selective attention deficits previously observed in schizophrenia are not specific to the disorder.

TI  - Mental disorders after myelography with metrizamide and other water-soluble contrast media
AU  - Schmidt, R C
PY  - 1980
AB  - Water-soluble contrast media, which have been employed in the examination of the lumbar spinal canal for 30 years, can sometimes result in severe complications, such as arachnoiditis, epileptic seizures, and myoclonic spasm. These complications have been seen less frequently since the advent of metrizamide, a new non-ionic water-soluble contrast medium. However, a further neurological complication has now arisen--mental disorder, varying in kind and degree; for example, organic psychosis and perceptual disturbance. Some characteristic cases are described. A series of 75 patients, all of whom received varying amounts of metrizamide for the purpose of cervical, thoracic and lumbar myelography, has been studied. Seven patients were found to have a pronounced organic psychosis and three patients had visual illusions or hallucinations. It is suggested that there is some degree of correlation between the total amount of iodine received and patient age. By careful enquiry and examination, similar disturbances were also found some 4-8 h after myelography with other water-soluble contrast media.

PY  - 1979
AB  - Letter-naming and dot enumeration tasks, designed to elicit left- and right-hemisphere functioning, respectively, were presented tachistoscopically to 20 adult paranoid (P) and nonparanoid (NP) schizophrenics, 10 nonschizophrenic psychiatric controls, and 10 normal Ss. Types of information-processing used by the schizophrenics were also examined. All groups identified letters with greater accuracy with left hemisphere presentation. Group differences in the letter task disappeared once education was controlled. No hemisphere effect was found for dot enumeration, but group differences emerged. As predicted, Ps and controls processed the dots serially and hence decreased in accuracy over frame size. NPs processed in an automatic mode, revealing the same degree of accuracy over all dot sizes. The poorer performance of the NPs in dot enumeration is discussed in terms of the task requiring bilateral processing and the NPs' failure to integrate the processing of the 2 hemispheres.

AB  - 70 hospitalized schizophrenic and 71 normal adults were given a test consisting of 6 human figure drawings arranged in a thematic sequence from a self-portrait to a drawing of a person. The structural components of each human figure were scored and analyzed in an attempt to validate their projective character and to examine influence of psychopathology on cognition. Findings indicate similar constructional trends for both groups, with differences particular to sex, rather than a diagnostic category. It is concluded that conception and representation of space and its configurations will not be influenced by psychopathological processes.

AB  - 24 male schizophrenics, 12 with schizophrenia in the immediate family (SFH) and 12 with no evidence of schizophrenia in the family background (SNFH), and 24 male control Ss, 12 highly educated (HEC) and 12 minimally educated (MEC), were assessed for premorbid social adjustment and were administered the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a size estimation task, and the EEG average evoked response (AER) at different levels of stimulus intensity. As predicted from the stimulus redundancy formulation, SFH Ss were poorer in premorbid adjustment, were less often paranoid, functioned at a lower level of cognitive efficiency (poor digit symbol and greater absolute error on size estimation), were more chronic, and, in some respects, had size estimation indices of minimal scanning. Contrary to prediction, the SFH group had the strongest and most sustained augmenting response on AER, while the SNFH group shifted from an augmenting to a reducing pattern of response. The relationship between an absence of AER reducing and the presence of cognitive impairment in the SFH group is discussed. (33 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied perceptual response styles of 8 paranoid and 8 nonparanoid schizophrenics in a VA hospital using size estimation and perceptual recognition tasks. Eight alcoholic patients were used as controls. Only acute, actively psychotic, unmedicated schizophrenics were included. Heart rate responses were monitored during the performance of the tasks. Psychological task performance and concomitant physiological responses were analyzed and integrated. The size estimation results replicate earlier findings. During the perceptual recognition task, the paranoid Ss showed a unique "jump to conclusions" response strategy. Early responding and response rigidity was not found to be specific to paranoid schizophrenics. All schizophrenic Ss showed more large-magnitude heart rate response during both tasks. The relationship between perceptual responses and physiological responses differed among the groups. (45 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AU  - Asarnow, R F
AU  - Mann, R
PY  - 1978
AB  - Fifteen paranoid and 15 nonparanoid schizophrenics and 15 normal controls were administered a size estimation task which featured two administrations of nonthematic standard stimuli. The standard stimuli were presented under three conditions of background stimuli: a) surrounded by four smaller stimuli of the same kind; b) surrounded by four larger stimuli of the same kind; c) presented without background stimuli. Standard stimuli were presented at exposure times of 33 and 4000 milliseconds. On the first administration, nonparanoid schizophrenics were found to overestimate size relative to paranoidschizophrenics with normal controls intermediate in performance between the paranoid schizophrenics and nonparanoid schizophrenics, particularly on longer stimulus exposure times. The groups did not differ on the second administration. This replication of the results of earlier investigations suggest that the repeated administration of size estimation procedures in which the effects of sequence and thematic content stimuli were inextricably confounded may have contributed to recent conflicting findings in the size estimation literature. Contrary to predictions generated by Cromwell's stimulus redundancy formation, the paranoid schizophrenics were not more affected by the size of the background stimuli than the nonparanoid schizophrenics.

TI  - Relationship between conceptual judgements and stimulus dimensions among schizophrenics and normals
AU  - Neufeld, R W
PY  - 1976
AB  - Eighteen paranoid schizophrenics, 18 non-paranoid schizophrenics and 18 normal subjects were shown a set of 36 schematic drawings of human faces. The faces varied along four dimensions: nose length, chin length, distance between eyes, and forehead height. Subjects were asked to rate each face as either 'intelligent' or 'unintelligent' and then as either 'contented' or 'discontented'. The paranoid schizophrenics were less systematic than both the normals and non-paranoid schizophrenics in their use of the stimulus dimensions in the judgements, the latter two groups not significantly differing in this respect. It was also found that there were significant differences among the groups regarding the average importance given to the different physical features, the profiles for the two schizophrenic groups being flatter than that of the non-schizophrenics. The results suggested there were two aspects of consistency in dimension utilization involved in the overall group differences-between-subject and within-subject consistency. The paranoid schizophrenics displayed low within-subject consistency, the non-paranoid schizophrenics displayed a high within-subject consistency but low between-subject consistency (i.e. an idiosyncratic weighting of dimensions in their judgements), and the non-schizophrenics displayed high within- and between-subject consistency.

AB  - Thirteen autistic children were compared to 13 normal children matched to them in mental age, on performance of a visual discrimination task. Form, color, and size were relevant and redundant cues. The groups did not differ significantly in mean trials to reach criterion or in breadth of learning, and both groups increased their breadth of learning after 50 trials of overtraining. Form was preferred to color and size by both autistic and normal children. Within each group, rank on mental age was highly correlated with rank in breadth of learning. Verbal and nonverbal autistic children did not differ in breadth of learning or in dimensional preference. Even nonverbal autistics equaled the performance of their normal controls. Our results suggest that overselective attention is better understood as part of a general developmental lag in cognition in autistic children than as a specific deficit underlying psychotic behavior.

TI  - The developmental approach and process-reactive schizophrenia: A review
AU  - Putterman, Allan H
AU  - Pollack, Herbert B
PY  - 1976
AB  - There has long been dissatisfaction with the concept of schizophrenia as a unitary disease process. Since Kraepelin's (1919) definition of dementia praecox as an incurable, deteriorative disorder, there have been attempts to differentiate various kinds of schizophrenias. The differentiation most commonly used in clinical practice has been that based on labeling different clusters of symptoms, as in simple schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, hebephrenia, and so on. Another differentiation, to be described more fully, is the process-reactive one based on a patient's particular life history and prognosis. A trend throughout much of the literature relates some of the research in the process-reactive area to one critical area-the developmental level. The developmental view maintains that process and reactive schizophrenics are at different levels of maturation in any or all modes of functioning, either being fixated at some particular stage or having regressed to a particular stage. The emphasis of the present paper will be on three particular areas of study: conceptual, verbal, and perceptual functioning. The developmental differences that are evident may have serious implications for the therapeutic approach to the two types of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, there is often no attention at all paid to the process-reactive distinction in treatment procedures. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Replicated and extended an earlier study, to test the prediction from the W. E. Broen and L. H. Storms theory that under certain conditions schizophrenics will display an arousal-produced decrement at the training stimulus on a generalization gradient. 14 acute schizophrenics and 10 nonschizophrenics were taught to press a lever to the left when a large square was projected and to the right for a small square. These squares and 6 graded squares of intermediate size were presented during test trials, while Ss gripped a dynamometer at 0, 1/6th, and 1/3rd of maximum tension. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded. As predicted, schizophrenics showed a significant decrement at the training stimulus under 1/3rd maximum tension but no decrement at the most remote generalization stimulus with the same dominant response. Nonschizophrenics showed no decrement at any stimuli. Heart rate but not skin conductance showed a significant increase with increased muscle tension in both groups.

PY  - 1974
AB  - Found that relationships between premorbid adjustment, schizophrenia subtype, stimulus content, and size judgments of thematic stimuli were substantially dependent on the sequences in which stimuli were presented. Ss were 36 paranoid and 36 nonparanoid schizophrenics, and a comparison sample of 36 prisoners, matched for length of institutionalization. Individual differences in schizophrenics' size estimations were not simply related to premorbid adjustment, schizophrenic subtype, or to 2 common measures of chronicity-length of illness and length of hospitalization-while proportion of time hospitalized since 1st admission, interacting with schizophrenia subtype, was correlated with size judgments.

AU  - Ritzler, Barry

PY  - 1973
AB  - Used a proprioceptive size estimation task to assess the magnitude of kinesthetic figural aftereffects (KFAs) between 11 acute and 11 chronic male schizophrenics and 11 normal male undergraduate controls. Controls demonstrated the largest KFAs. Acute schizophrenics showed less responsivity than normals to proprioceptive stimulation, and chronic schizophrenics manifested the lowest mean KFA score of the 3 groups. Results are discussed as evidence in support of the hypothesis of a proprioceptive deficit in schizophrenia. Results also are interpreted as casting some doubt on the validity of the concept of kinesthetic control of stimulus intensity in schizophrenic size-estimation performance.

AB  - In a study with 94 institutionalized schizophrenic residents of a token economy ward, S. D. Asch's perceptual conformity procedure identified 20 "independents" and 12 "yielders." Performance on a letter cancellation task under different reinforcement conditions indicated that yielders evidenced maximum performance during the social reinforcement condition and independents performed best during token and monetary reinforcement conditions. Results are interpreted in the context of role theory and the impression-management hypothesis and suggest that patients will engage in behaviors which are reinforced in ways that are congruent with their orientation to the interpersonal world.

AB  - Related body-height perception to T. Lidz's theory of dominance by the mother during the development of the schizophrenic male. Slides were used to compare self-perceptions and perceptions of a maternal figure for 20 normal and 20 chronic undifferentiated schizophrenic males (mean age = 48 yrs). Data support Lidz's postulations; schizophrenics underestimated their own body size and overestimated the size of a maternal figure more than normals. In addition, when a maternal figure and S's own figure were presented simultaneously, schizophrenics underestimated their own perceived body heights more than normals. (15 ref.)

TI  - The size constancy problem in schizophrenia: A cognitive skill analysis
AU  - Hamilton, Vernon
PY  - 1972
AB  - Hypothesized that (a) an impairment of basic cognitive skills (particularly conservation) differentiates schizophrenics and normals and under-constant and over-constant nonparanoid schizophrenics, and (b) that this and an associated primitive visual centration effect may lead to paradoxical over-constancy for some schizophrenics. 24 male nonparanoid process schizophrenics and 12 normal controls were given a size constancy task. Results confirm that schizophrenics may be both under- and over-constant, and that they exhibit significantly low levels in primitive cognitive operations. The latter abnormalities are particularly marked in over-constant schizophrenics, for whom there is strong evidence of centration with a distant standard. Results suggest that contradictory findings of over- and under-constancy in nonparanoid schizophrenics may be a function of differences in the availability of conserving operations and centration strategies, where the latter would be influenced by characteristics of the experimental display.

AB  - Constructed a test battery designed to evaluate intellectual, verbal, motor, perceptual-motor, and perceptual task performance levels of preschool psychotic children. The battery was used in an experimental comparison of psychotic (11 early schizophrenic, 19 primary autistic, and 35 secondary autistic) and nonpsychotic subnormal (n = 29) children whose CA group means ranged from 56.1-71.8 mo. The comparison involved selected adaptive (nonverbal intellectual and perceptual-motor), verbal, and motor tasks, all also performed by 3 normal Ss. Subnormal Ss were significantly more advanced than the schizophrenic Ss in 2 motor tasks, and than the primary autistic, in all excepting the Seguin formboard and stair climbing. Primary autistic Ss were better at stair climbing than the schizophrenic Ss whose motor performance profiles proved similar to those of lower functioning autistic. The discussion is focused on etiological implications of results. (30 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

No significant group differences were found in the size estimation levels, or when the groups were subdivided on the basis of both premorbid adjustment and paranoid status. All Ss increased their size estimation levels over the 3 trial blocks. The thematic content of the stimuli produced a significant effect in the chronic schizophrenic group, with the nonthreatening scenes being overestimated relative to the threatening scenes. Some methodological problems common to size estimation studies are noted, and the growing inconsistency in the size estimation literature is hypothesized to be due to these problems. (23 ref.)

Conversely, 35 chronics in the same age range maintaining active internal lives were inattentive to external stimuli. The Petrie procedure appeared uncorrelated with the Silverman kinesthetic figural aftereffect. Results show that overestimation after Petrie large-stimulus interpolation relates to passive behavior; overestimation after small-stimulus interpolation relates to good intellectual and psychological functioning among all, and among chronics to behavioral and conceptual expansiveness.

AB  - 119 schizophrenics and 56 normal Os judged lengths of lines and preferences for musical excerpts by category rating and magnitude estimation. In the scalings of music preferences, schizophrenic Ss were comparable to normals in their scale forms, inter-scale matching, and intergroup agreement, but their scale range was shortened and constrictive. Individual data showed poor internal consistency and heterogeneity for the schizophrenic Ss in the use of categories and numerals, which presumably accounts for the scale constriction. Data also revealed a high response polarization and perseveration, low average uncertainty, loose category and numeral boundaries, and constrictive use of magnitude. In the scaling of line lengths, such effects were not found, with the exceptions of the low internal consistency and constrictive use of numbers. Observations are related to theoretical formulations on schizophrenia, i.e., paradoxical sensitivity, associative disturbances, and response interferences. (32 ref.)

In Study I, the correlations between the 2 measures occurred in opposite directions for 24 normal males and females; the difference between the correlations for the sexes was statistically significant. In Study II, the same effect was observed in 23 male and female ambulatory schizophrenics. Results of these studies indicate that a perceptual differentiation interpretation of RFT performance is erroneous for certain kinds of Ss. Accurate RFT performance can be achieved by constricting one's field of attention and not responding to background cues. (25 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

The main result was that premorbid adjustment and chronicity interacted in size-estimation performance with the good, premorbid-adjustment group exhibiting a smaller size estimation in the chronic condition than in the acute, while the poor, premorbid-adjustment group exhibited the opposite effect. Although a Premorbid Adjustment * Chronicity interaction was predicted in previous work, the specific over- or underestimation tendency found for each schizophrenic subgroup differed from those previously predicted. The differences in the present results and predictions derived from a review of the literature are discussed in terms of possible difficulties inherent in making inferences from studies which did not directly control the relevant subject dimensions. Results indicate little support for the social-censure hypothesis and suggest the greater effect of organismic variables relative to stimulus variables in predicting schizophrenic task performance.

AU  - Magaro, Peter A
PY  - 1969
AB  - Examined 2 methodological aspects of the form-discrimination and size-estimation tasks employed in the literature dealing with the deficit performance of schizophrenics. Ss were 60 male undergraduates. The results indicated that the tasks were relatively independent although level of anxiety was related to a decrease in performance level on each task. In comparing the 2 discriminative dimensions of angle size and horizontal distance, it was found the horizontal distance was more difficult especially for high-anxiety normals. This result was discussed in terms of the studies with schizophrenics which used discriminative tasks and found more errors on an angular dimension.

Findings tend to support a heuristic theory of abnormal (verbal) behavior relating reports of OP distortions to the symptoms of depersonalization and derealization. The indices of OP and of depersonalization, derealization relate reliably to other more established predictors of psychiatric states and to the verbal behavior of patients and controls.

AU  - McKinnon, T

PY  - 1969
AB  - In recent studies it has been inferred from performance on perceptual tasks, that paranoid schizophrenics showed extensive scanning and nonparanoid schizophrenics showed minimal scanning. Eye movements during free-search and size-judgment tasks were recorded for 14 paranoid and 14 nonparanoid schizophrenics, 14 psychotic depressives, and 14 control Ss. Medicated Ss showed lower eyemovement rate and fixation rate than nonmedicated Ss and controls, but there were no significant differences due to schizophrenia. There was a significant interaction between patient type and medication for size-judgment means, but all such differences were reduced to nonsignificance by training. Even after training, Ss showed greater variability in size judgments than controls. Results failed to support the notion of extensive or minimal scanning behavior of schizophrenics. Errors by the psychotic patients in making size judgments were not correlated with scanning behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 1969
AB  - Attempts to sort out the sources of some of the inconsistent findings in terms of a detailed examination of between-studies differences in task and S variables. It is concluded that acute good premorbid schizophrenics show small but consistent size underestimation. Acute poor premorbid schizophrenics show a small but reliable tendency toward size overestimation. Paranoid schizophrenics underestimate, while nonparanoids overestimate, stimulus size. Among all schizophrenic groups the effects of drug status and relative acuteness or chronicity are at present not well specified. More research on task variables such as memory and viewing time is clearly required. A reanalysis of some previous data indicates that schizophrenics did not differ from normals in perceptual accuracy. The question of attributing differences in size estimation to a sensory process is raised. The present theories of flexibility, scanning, and redundancy do not provide complete explanations of the data. With the relevant variables more precisely identified, progress toward a more complete theory may be made. (28 ref.) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 15 good premorbid paranoid acute schizophrenics, 15 poor premorbid nonparanoid acute schizophrenics, and 15 attendants, all males, estimated stimulus paranoid size after receiving (a) 10-sec. and (b) 100-msec. presentations of the standard, also (c) 10-msec. blank flashes instead of the standard. Choices were then made from a group of variable-sized stimuli. As expected, good paranoids, normals, and poor nonparanoids tended to low, intermediate, and high estimation levels, respectively. Contrary to eye-movement interpretation, patient groups differed under the 100-msec. presentation. Lowered estimation level with this presentation suggested stimulus redundancy interpretations. No differences with the blank flash ruled out a simple size-preference response bias. Equal proportions of "hits" among groups indicated that error distributions rather than error frequencies accounted for the results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Perceptual differences between normals and schizophrenics revealed by traditional size-constancy experiments are questionable because of S variability, procedural difficulties, and problems inherent in traditional psychophysical methods. A review of the literature reveals few consistent results. The present study compared normals, paranoid schizophrenics, and nonparanoid schizophrenics on a size-constancy task which allowed derivation of additional dependent variables from signal-detection and uncertainty analysis. No group differences were revealed using the size-constancy procedure, but signal-detection analysis indicated nonparanoid schizophrenics were significantly lower in perceptual sensitivity. Uncertainty analysis revealed additional response dispositions characteristic of the schizophrenic groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual perception is abnormal in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. In addition to hallucinations, laboratory tests show differences in fundamental visual processes including contrast sensitivity, center-surround interactions, and perceptual organization. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain visual dysfunction in psychotic disorders, including an imbalance between excitation and inhibition. However, the precise neural basis of abnormal visual perception in people with psychotic psychopathology (PwPP) remains unknown. Here, we describe the behavioral and 7 tesla MRI methods we used to interrogate visual neurophysiology in PwPP as part of the Psychosis Human Connectome Project (HCP). In addition to PwPP (n = 66) and healthy controls (n = 43), we also recruited first-degree biological relatives (n = 44) in order to examine the role of genetic liability for psychosis in visual perception. Our visual tasks were designed to assess fundamental visual processes in PwPP, whereas MR spectroscopy enabled us to examine neurochemistry, including excitatory and inhibitory markers. We show that it is feasible to collect high-quality data across multiple psychophysical, functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy experiments with a sizable number of participants at a single research site. These data, in addition to those from our previously described 3 tesla experiments, will be made publicly available in order to facilitate further investigations by other research groups. By combining visual neuroscience techniques and HCP brain imaging methods, our experiments offer new opportunities to investigate the neural basis of abnormal visual perception in PwPP.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Psychosis is frequently associated with the occurrence of visual hallucinations (VH), but their etiology remains largely unknown. While patients with psychosis show deficits on various behavioral visual and attentional tasks, previous studies have not specifically related these deficits to the presence of VH. This suggests that tasks used in these studies do not target the visual-cognitive neural mechanisms that mediate VH, which in turn limits the development of effective therapies. We therefore designed a study to target these mechanisms directly. In this case control study we asked patients with psychosis who had previously experienced VH to indicate when they recognized objects that were gradually emerging from dynamic visual noise, while scanning their brains using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. In a previous study, this recognition task was used to identify the neural basis of VH in patients with Parkinson's Disease. Based on this earlier work, we decided to test the following hypothesis: when compared to psychosis patients not experiencing VH and age-matched healthy controls, psychosis patients with VH show reduced occipital activity and frontal activity around the moment of recognition (known as pop-out). For all groups, neuroimaging revealed increased activity in all examined visual areas around pop-out. However, psychosis patients with VH showed reduced occipital responsiveness, especially in the inferior part of the bilateral lateral occipital complex, a region known to play a key role in object recognition. We did not observe altered frontal or prefrontal activity before pop-out in this group. A possible explanation is that the relatively sustained activation of the visual memory-related angular gyri around pop-out may have compensated for the impaired early visual processing in psychosis patients with VH. We discuss our results in terms of current theories of visual hallucinations, such as predictive coding and contextual modulation. Our study is the first to show that visual processing deficits contribute to the occurrence of VH in psychosis. These findings could be used to develop tests to identify the visual-cognitive mechanisms that mediate VH in this group.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Perceptual distortions are core features of psychosis. Weakened surround suppression has been proposed as a neural mechanism of such atypical perceptual experiences. While previous work has measured suppression by asking participants to report the perceived contrast of a low-contrast target surrounded by a high-contrast surround, it is possible to modulate perceived contrast solely by manipulating the orientation of a matched-contrast center and surround. Removing the bottom-up segmentation cue of contrast difference and isolating the orientation-dependent suppression may clarify the neural processes responsible for atypical surround suppression in psychosis. We examined surround suppression across a spectrum of psychotic psychopathology including people with schizophrenia (PSZ; N=31) and bipolar disorder (PBD; N=29), first-degree biological relatives of these patient groups (PBDrel, PSZrel; N=28, N=21, respectively), and healthy controls (N=29). Surround suppression deficits in PSZ, while observable under many stimulus conditions, were absent under the condition that produced the strongest suppression. PBD and PSZrel exhibited intermediate suppression, while PBDrel performed most similarly to controls. Intriguingly, group differences in surround suppression magnitude were moderated by visual acuity. We propose a potential model by which visual acuity and/or focal attention interact with untuned gain control that reproduces the observed pattern of results including the lack of group differences when orientation of center and surround are the same. Our findings further elucidate perceptual mechanisms of impaired center-surround processing in psychosis and provide insights into the effects of visual acuity on orientation-dependent suppression in PSZ.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

AB  - Background: Contextual processing dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) is not uniform and task-dependent. In SCZ, studies on the rod and frame test (RFT), which evaluates contextual modulation of verticality perception, are sparse. A main study that utilized a two-alternative forced choice design for judging rod verticality reported equivalent strength of RFT contextual modulation in healthy controls and SCZ. The current study aims to uncover any potential differences in contextual modulation between controls and SCZ with an adjustment method on a computerized RFT. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 17 healthy controls and 15 SCZ aligned an oriented rod to their perceived vertical with a computer mouse under four randomized frame presentations: absent frame, non-tilted (Frame0degree), or tilted by 18 degrees leftward (Frame-18degree) or rightward (Frame+18degree). Rod deviation error was assigned a negative or positive value when aligned leftward or rightward, respectively, of 0degree. Signed and absolute errors, the rod and frame effect (RFE), and intra-individual variability (inconsistency) were used for analysis. Result(s): There was no group difference in rod alignment errors or derived measures, except that SCZ displayed greater inconsistency in rod alignment, compared to controls. The negative symptom scale (PANSS-N) scores correlated positively with the variability measure and with unsigned Frame-18degree error. Conclusion(s): Only the variability measure was sensitive enough to distinguish between controls and SCZ. SCZ with more severe negative symptoms had larger variability in rod alignment, probably reflecting a state of indifference. The larger deviation errors only with a leftward tilted frame, as PANSS-N scores increased, may indicate a lateralized attentional abnormality that is correlated with severity of symptoms in SCZ.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022 Razzak, Jahrami, Husni, Ali and Bagust.

AB  - Background: Understanding the mechanisms in the brain's incentive network that give rise to symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) during adolescence provides new perspectives to address MDD in early stages of development. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study determines whether instrumental vigor and brain responses to appetitive and aversive monetary incentives are altered in adolescent MDD and associated with symptom severity. Method(s): Adolescents with moderate to severe MDD (n = 30, mean age [SD] = 16.1 [1.4] years) and healthy control subjects (n = 33, mean age = 16.2 [1.9] years) matched for age, sex, and IQ performed a monetary incentive delay task. During outcome presentation, prediction error signals were used to study the response and coupling of the incentive network during learning of cue-outcome associations. A computational reinforcement model was used to assess adaptation of response vigor. Brain responses and effective connectivity to model-derived prediction errors were assessed and related to depression severity and anhedonia levels. Result(s): Participants with MDD behaved according to a more simplistic learning model and exhibited slower learning. Effective connectivity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that impaired loss error processing in the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with aberrant gain control. Anhedonia scores correlated with loss-related error signals in the posterior insula and habenula. Conclusion(s): Adolescent MDD is selectively related to impaired processing of error signals during loss, but not reward, in the orbitofrontal cortex. Aberrant evaluation of loss outcomes might reflect an early mechanism of how negative bias and helplessness manifest in the brain. This approach sheds light on pathomechanisms in MDD and may improve early diagnosis and treatment selection.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 Society of Biological Psychiatry

TI  - Self-monitoring in schizophrenia: Weighting exteroceptive visual signals against self-generated vestibular cues
AU  - Seymour K.
AU  - Kaliuzhna M.
PY  - 2022
AB  - Disturbances in self-monitoring are core symptoms of schizophrenia. Some research suggests an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues and a reduced weighting of self-generated interoceptive signals to guide perception. The vestibular sense provides important self-generated information about the body in space. Alterations of vestibular function are reported in schizophrenia, but it is unknown whether internally generated vestibular information is discounted in favour of exteroceptive input. In this study, we test for evidence of an over-reliance on exteroceptive visual cues and a reduced weighting of vestibular signals in guiding perception. In a group of individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, we used a well-studied visual illusion - the Tilt Illusion - to probe the respective weight given to visual and vestibular cues in judging line orientation. The Tilt Illusion reveals that perceived orientation of a vertical grating is biased by the orientation in its surround. This illusion increases when the head is tilted, due to the reduced reliability of vestibular information that would otherwise provide an internally generated reference for vertical. We predicted that an over-reliance on exteroceptive cues in schizophrenia would lead to a reduced susceptibility to the effects of head position on Tilt Illusion strength. We find no difference between patients and controls. Both groups show comparable Tilt Illusion magnitudes that increase when the head is tilted. Thus, our findings suggest that chronic patients with schizophrenia adequately combine self-generated vestibular cues and exteroceptive visual input to judge line verticality. A stronger reliance on exteroceptive information over internally generated signals in guiding perception is not evident in our data. Deficits in self-monitoring might therefore be modality specific or state dependant.Copyright <c2><a9> 2022

TI  - Memory-guided saccades in psychosis: Effects of medication and stimulus location
AU  - Smith E.S.
AU  - Crawford T.J.
PY  - 2021
AB  - The memory-guided saccade task requires the remembrance of a peripheral target location, whilst inhibiting the urge to make a saccade ahead of an auditory cue. The literature has explored the endophenotypic deficits associated with differences in target laterality, but less is known about target amplitude. The data presented came from Crawford et al. (1995), employing a memory-guided saccade task among neuroleptically medicated and non-medicated patients with schizophrenia (n=31, n=12), neuroleptically medicated and non-medicated bipolar affective disorder (n=12, n=17), and neurotypical controls (n=30). The current analyses explore the relationships between memory-guided saccades toward targets with different eccentricities (7.5degree and 15degree), the discernible behaviour exhibited amongst diagnostic groups, and cohorts distinguished based on psychotic symptomatology. Saccade gain control and final eye position were reduced among medicated-schizophrenia patients. These metrics were reduced further among targets with greater amplitudes (15degree), indicating greater deficit. The medicated cohort exhibited reduced gain control and final eye positions in both amplitudes compared to the non-medicated cohort, with deficits markedly observed for the furthest targets. No group differences in symptomatology (positive and negative) were reported, however, a greater deficit was observed toward the larger amplitude. This suggests that within the memory-guided saccade paradigm, diagnostic classification is more prominent in characterising disparities in saccade performance than symptomatology.Copyright <c2><a9> 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The glutamatergic modulator ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and bipolar disorder. While its underlying mechanism of antidepressant action is not fully understood, modulating glutamatergically-mediated connectivity appears to be a critical component moderating antidepressant response. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 19 drug-free individuals with TRD and 15 healthy volunteers who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous infusion of saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6-9 h after both drug and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants completed an attentional dot probe task that included emotional faces. Antidepressant response was measured across time points using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure changes in parameter estimates of connectivity via a biophysical model that included realistic local neuronal architecture and receptor channel signaling, modeling connectivity between the early visual cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, and inferior frontal gyrus. Clinically, ketamine administration significantly reduced depressive symptoms in TRD participants. Within the model, ketamine administration led to faster gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) transmission in the early visual cortex, faster NMDA transmission in the fusiform cortex, and slower NMDA transmission in the amygdala. Ketamine administration also led to direct and indirect changes in local inhibition in the early visual cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and to indirect increases in cortical excitability within the amygdala. Finally, reductions in depressive symptoms in TRD participants post-ketamine were associated with faster alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) transmission and increases in gain control of spiny stellate cells in the early visual cortex. These findings provide additional support for the GABA and NMDA inhibition and disinhibition hypotheses of depression and support the role of AMPA throughput in ketamine's antidepressant effects.

AB  - Upside-down reversal of vision (UDRV) is a rare form of metamorphopsia, or visual illusions that can distort the size, shape or inclination of objects. This phenomenon is paroxysmal and transient in nature, with patients reporting a sudden inversion of vision in the coronal plane, which typically remains for seconds or minutes, though occasionally persists for hours or days, before returning to normal. Distorted egocentric orientation (ie, the patient perceives the body to be tilted away from the vertical plane) is even more rare as a co-occurring phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a veteran who presented with UDRV and distorted egocentric orientation during hospitalisation on an inpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation setting following an elective hip surgery. This case serves not only to document the presence of rare visual illusions, but also illustrates the importance and value of an interdisciplinary team approach.Copyright <c2><a9> BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

TI  - Impaired contrast gain control in psychosis
AU  - Schallmo M.-P.
AU  - Moser H.
AU  - Marjanska M.
AU  - Sponheim S.
PY  - 2021
AB  - Background: Contrast perception is a fundamental function of the human visual system. Previous work suggests impaired visual contrast perception among people with psychosis spectrum disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), but the neural basis of this anomaly remains unclear. One possibility may be a difference in gain control, which describes how neural responses change with increasing stimulus intensity. Effective gain control maintains the dynamic response range and prevents responses from becoming too large. If gain control is impaired in psychosis, this might account for abnormalities in visual contrast perception. Method(s): We recruited female and male participants from three groups: people with psychosis (n = 52), their first-degree biological relatives (n = 43), and healthy controls (n = 43). Studying relatives permitted us to examine the role of genetic liability for psychosis in visual perception. We measured visual contrast perception in a behavioral threshold versus contrast paradigm, with seven stimulus intensities between 0-20% contrast. Threshold versus contrast data were fit using standard (i.e., Naka-Rushton) equations, in order to obtain predicted contrast response functions from our behavioral data. We also acquired 7 tesla functional MRI data during visual contrast perception in the same participants, which allowed us to quantify neural contrast response functions in visual cortex. Finally, we obtained 7 tesla MR spectroscopy data from these participants, in order to quantify neural metabolite concentrations in early visual cortex. Result(s): Contrast discrimination thresholds were overall higher (worse) among people with psychosis compared with relatives and controls (X^2(2) = 6.80, p = 0.033). Poorer contrast discrimination was correlated with higher psychiatric symptoms (BPRS; r (105) = 0.29, p = 0.002). Computational modeling of behavioral data revealed significant differences in contrast-response function parameters between groups (group differences for jackknifed model fits, X^2(2) values > 73.5, p-values < 1 x 10^-16). In particular, people with psychosis and relatives showed higher contrast response function slopes, which may be consistent with impaired contrast gain control. This was offset by a lower inflection point (both groups) and lower overall response scaling (especially in psychosis), such that predicted neural responses were lower for the psychosis group but not relatives, compared to controls. 7 T fMRI responses in primary visual cortex (V1) were similar across groups (F(2,95) = 1.66, p = 0.19), indicating a mismatch between predicted and observed neural responses in people with psychosis. Glutamate and GABA levels in visual cortex from 7 T MR spectroscopy did not differ between groups (X^2(2) values > 2.58, p-values > 0.3), but higher GABA was correlated with poorer behavioral contrast discrimination across all subjects (r (100) = 0.23, p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Our results may be explained by a combination of two effects: 1) an overall deficit in task performance across all conditions in people with psychosis, yielding worse discrimination for all contrast levels, and 2) impaired contrast gain control in both the psychosis and relative groups, which leads to differences in the pattern of behavioral responses at certain stimulus intensities. If an overall impairment in discrimination task performance depends on a higher-level cognitive deficit, rather than lower neural activity overall in visual cortex (as predicted by the model), then this might be sufficient to explain the mismatch we observed between model predictions and V1 fMRI responses in people with psychosis. Our findings highlight the potential value of studying biological relatives of people with psychosis. Like affected individuals, behavioral data from relatives also appeared consistent with impaired gain control, suggesting that abnormal contrast gain control might be linked to genetic liability for psychosis. But unlike the psychosis group, relatives showed a good match between model predictions and V1 fMRI results, which may help us to differentiate the effects of a generalized deficit and impaired contrast gain control in this data set. Finally, although we found no group differences in glutamate or GABA, our spectroscopy results suggest that higher GABA levels may be associated with reduced contrast sensitivity across all subjects.

AB  - Abstract Action termination and maintenance of postural control in response to stimuli are critical components of behavioral arrest. While co-activation of multiple pathways allows for behavioral arrest in a context-dependent manner, the modulation of these circuits and their contributing effects to movement suppression and gain control is unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of electrical stimulation on intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus to clarify their discrete contributions to behavioral arrest. Mice were implanted with bipolar electrical stimulating electrodes in multiple focal nuclei and introduced to the open field test. Varying low frequency stimulation train protocols were used and behavior was monitored for 60-minute trial periods. Behavioral arrest was observed with high fidelity upon stimulation in discrete regions of the intralminar thalamus, with changes in habituation and overall locomotion observed in the open field. This suggests that pathways from the intralaminar thalamus differentially modulate locomotion with a gain control function. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the corticothalamic circuits involved in behavioral arrest, with major implications for the development of neuromodulatory therapies for psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD).

AB  - Background/Objective: Patients with schizophrenia not only have psychiatric symptoms, but also have movement problems, which might also be associated with their reduced quality of life. Little is known about how to improve their movement performance for patients. Manipulating object size and distance is common in occupational therapy practice to evaluate and optimize reaching performance in patients with physical disabilities, but effects of the manipulation in patients with schizophrenia remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine whether object size and distance could change performance of reaching kinematics in patients with mild schizophrenia. Method(s): Twenty-nine patients with mild schizophrenia and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were required to reach for, as quickly as possible, a small or large object that was placed at a near or far distance. We measured movement time, peak velocity, path length ratio, percentage of time to peak velocity, and movement units to infer movement speed, forcefulness, spatial efficiency (directness), control strategies, and smoothness. Result(s): Patients' reaching movements were slower (p =.017) and less direct (p =.007) than those of controls. A larger object induced faster (p =.016), more preprogrammed (p =.018), and more forceful (p =.010) movements in patients. A farther object induced slower, more feedback dependent, but more forceful and more direct movements (all p <.001). Conclusion(s): The results of kinematic deficiencies suggest the need of movement training for patients with mild schizophrenia. Occupational therapists may grade or adapt reaching activities by changing object size and distance to enhance movement performance in patients with schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Effective treatment strategies for schizophrenia remain very challenging and many treatment-resistant patients will suffer from persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). While clozapine is the gold-standard medication for this complex population, many will not respond to this molecule. For these ultra-resistant patients, limited options are available. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely used psychological intervention, though it offers modest effects. With the interpersonal dimension of AVH being recognized, Avatar Therapy (AT), a novel experiential treatment enabling patients to create an avatar of their persecutor and allowing them to gain control over their symptoms, was developed and tested. Results have shown significant improvements in AVH symptomatology. This paper details a case report showcasing the beneficial results of AT for even the most severe and symptomatic cases of schizophrenia. Mr. Smith has been afflicted with the persistency of all his voices for almost 20 years. To our knowledge, this patient tried almost all possible treatments with little efficacy. This case highlights the difficulty of finding an adequate treatment for ultra-resistant patients. Mr. Smith first followed CBT before initiating AT. With AT, he significantly improved in a way that was not observed with any other intervention and these improvements remained afterward. The severity of his positive symptoms as well as his depressive symptoms diminished, and his most distressing persecutory voice disappeared. He was able to regain a life. The effects of AT went well beyond the patient, the morale of the entire family improved. This ultra-resistant case suggests that AT may be a promising intervention for refractory AVH in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - It is not just in faces! Processing of emotion and intention from biological motion in psychiatric disorders
AU  - Okruszek, Lukasz
PY  - 2018
AB  - Social neuroscience offers a wide range of techniques that may be applied to study the social cognitive deficits that may underlie reduced social functioning-a common feature across many psychiatric disorders. At the same time, a significant proportion of research in this area has been conducted using paradigms that utilize static displays of faces or eyes. The use of point-light displays (PLDs) offers a viable alternative for studying recognition of emotion or intention inference while minimizing the amount of information presented to participants. This mini-review aims to summarize studies that have used PLD to study emotion and intention processing in schizophrenia (SCZ), affective disorders, anxiety and personality disorders, eating disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Two main conclusions can be drawn from the reviewed studies: first, the social cognitive problems found in most of the psychiatric samples using PLD were of smaller magnitude than those found in studies presenting social information using faces or voices. Second, even though the information presented in PLDs is extremely limited, presentation of these types of stimuli is sufficient to elicit the disorder-specific, social cognitive biases (e.g., mood-congruent bias in depression, increased threat perception in anxious individuals, aberrant body size perception in eating disorders) documented using other methodologies. Taken together, these findings suggest that point-light stimuli may be a useful method of studying social information processing in psychiatry. At the same time, some limitations of using this methodology are also outlined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain. The level of GABA varies substantially across individuals, and this variability is associated with interindividual differences in visual perception. However, it remains unclear whether the association between GABA level and visual perception reflects a general influence of visual inhibition or whether the GABA levels of different cortical regions selectively influence perception of different visual features. To address this, we studied how the GABA levels of parietal and occipital cortices related to interindividual differences in size, orientation, and brightness perception. We used visual contextual illusion as a perceptual assay since the illusion dissociates perceptual content from stimulus content and the magnitude of the illusion reflects the effect of visual inhibition. Across individuals, we observed selective correlations between the level of GABA and the magnitude of contextual illusion. Specifically, parietal GABA level correlated with size illusion magnitude but not with orientation or brightness illusion magnitude; in contrast, occipital GABA level correlated with orientation illusion magnitude but not with size or brightness illusion magnitude. Our findings reveal a regionand feature-dependent influence of GABA level on human visual perception. Parietal and occipital cortices contain, respectively, topographic maps of size and orientation preference in which neural responses to stimulus sizes and stimulus orientations are modulated by intraregional lateral connections. We propose that these lateral connections may underlie the selective influence of GABA on visual perception.Copyright <c2><a9> 2017 Song, Sandberg et al.

PY  - 2017
AB  - Chloroquine is a prototype antimalarial drug, widely used in several branches of medicine. Antimalarial drugs are used in the treatment of various dermatological, immunological, rheumatological and infectious diseases. Examples of off-labelled indications for chloroquine analogues use include dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, polymorphous light eruption, disseminated granuloma annulare and porfiria cutanea tarda. There is a relatively small number of adverse effects related to chloroquine analogues used in standard doses, such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headaches, skin reactions, hypotension, convulsions, extrapyramidal symptoms and visual disturbances. Psychiatric side effects of chloroquine seem to be rare, but may manifest in a wide range of symptoms, such as confusion, disorientation, ideas of persecution, agitation, outbursts of violence, loss of interest, feeling sad, suicidal ideas and impaired insight. There is also a report of a manic episode with psychotic features in the course of bipolar disorder, and another case report of persecutory delusions, anxiety, derealisation and visual illusions triggered by chloroquine. The duration of psychiatric symptoms usually ranges from one to two weeks, and symptoms usually disappear within several days following cessation of chloroquine usage and starting psychiatric treatment where indicated. This article reviews the case studies of patients diagnosed with mental disorders resulting from the use of chloroquine, and discusses the management in such cases.Copyright <c2><a9> Medical Communications Sp. z o.o.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between psychometrically-defined schizotypy and the ability to detect a visual target pattern. Target detection is typically impaired by a surrounding pattern (context) with an orientation that is parallel to the target, relative to a surrounding pattern with an orientation that is orthogonal to the target (orientation-dependent contextual modulation). Based on reports that this effect is reduced in those with schizophrenia, we hypothesised that there would be a negative relationship between the relative score on psychometrically-defined schizotypy and the relative effect of orientation-dependent contextual modulation. We measured visual contrast detection thresholds and scores on the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE) from a non-clinical sample (N = 100). Contrary to our hypothesis, we find an absence of a monotonic relationship between the relative magnitude of orientation-dependent contextual modulation of visual contrast detection and the relative score on any of the subscales of the O-LIFE. The apparent difference of this result with previous reports on those with schizophrenia suggests that orientation-dependent contextual modulation may be an informative condition in which schizophrenia and psychometrically-defined schizotypy are dissociated. However, further research is also required to clarify the strength of orientationdependent contextual modulation in those with schizophrenia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2017 Mannion et al.

AB  - Retinal prosthesis offers a potential treatment for individuals suffering from photoreceptor degeneration diseases. Establishing biological retinal models and simulating how the biological retina convert incoming light signal into spike trains that can be properly decoded by the brain is a key issue. Some retinal models have been presented, ranking from structural models inspired by the layered architecture to functional models originated from a set of specific physiological phenomena. However, Most of these focus on stimulus image compression, edge detection and reconstruction, but do not generate spike trains corresponding to visual image. In this study, based on state-of-the-art retinal physiological mechanism, including effective visual information extraction, static nonlinear rectification of biological systems and neurons Poisson coding, a cascade model of the retina including the out plexiform layer for information processing and the inner plexiform layer for information encoding was brought forward, which integrates both anatomic connections and functional computations of retina. Using MATLAB software, spike trains corresponding to stimulus image were numerically computed by four steps: linear spatiotemporal filtering, static nonlinear rectification, radial sampling and then Poisson spike generation. The simulated results suggested that such a cascade model could recreate visual information processing and encoding functionalities of the retina, which is helpful in developing artificial retina for the retinally blind.Copyright <c2><a9> 2016, Editorial Board of Neural Regeneration Research.

PY  - 2016
AB  - The diversity and the specialized connectivity and function of inhibitory cortical neurons have been the focus of intense research for many decades (Fishell and Rudy, Ann Rev Neurosci 34:535-567, 2011). Until recently, technical limitations have restricted the power of experiments that could be conducted in vivo. Nevertheless, in vitro studies identified dozens of distinct cortical inhibitory neuron types, each with unique chemical properties, intrinsic firing properties and connection specificity. And at the same time, post-mortem studies from human patients have demonstrated defects of inhibitory circuit markers in diseases such as schizophrenia (Curley and Lewis, J Physiol 590:715-724, 2012; Stan and Lewis, Curr Pharm Biotech 13:1557-1562, 2012; Lewis, Curr Opin Neurobiol 26:22-26, 2014). Together, these observations have led to the hypothesis that distinct types of inhibitory neurons play distinct functional roles in the dynamic regulation of brain states and in the context-dependent extraction of sensory information, cognitive function, and behavioral output-functions thought to be disrupted in disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite the wealth of evidence in support of this hypothesis, tools have only recently emerged to allow detailed studies of neural circuit mechanisms underlying in vivo dynamics and to implicate specific inhibitory cell types and connections in specific functions (Luo et al., Neuron 57:634-660, 2008). Now, rather than broadly surveying inhibitory neuron properties and connections in vitro, studies have begun to focus more deeply on the in vivo contributions of those inhibitory cell types that are genetically accessible and can therefore be interrogated with modern genetic tools for manipulating and monitoring activity of specific cell types. Mouse lines that express Cre-recombinase selectively in three major, non-overlapping groups of inhibitory cortical neurons-Parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP; Lee et al., J Neurosci 30:16796-16808, 2010; Xu et al. J Comp Neurol 518:389-404, 2010; Rudy et al., J Comp Neurol 518:389-404, 2011; Taniguchi et al., J Comp Neurol 518:389-404, 2011)-have allowed detailed studies of the connectivity and in vivo functional roles of these cell groups. Such studies have implicated PV inhibitory neurons in gain control (Atallah et al., Neuron 73:159-170, 2012; Lee et al., Nature 488:379-383, 2012; Nienborg et al., J Neurosci 33:11145-11154, 2013), SST interneurons in the suppression of lateral and feedback (top-down) interactions (Adesnik and Scanziani, Nature 464:1155-1160, 2010; Nienborg et al., J Neurosci 33:11145-11154, 2013), and VIP interneurons in the dynamic regulation of SST cells under the control of brain state-dependent neuromodulators (Kawaguchi, J Neurophysiol 78:1743-1747, 1997; Alitto and Dan, Front Syst Neurosci 6:79, 2012; Lee et al., Nat Neurosci 16:1662-1670, 2013; Pi et al., Nature 503:521-524, 2013; Polack et al., Nat Neurosci 16:1331-1339, 2013; Fu et al., Cell 156:1139-1152, 2014; Stryker, Cold Spring Harbor Symp Quant Biol 79:1-9, 2014; Zhang et al., Science 345:660-665, 2014).Copyright <c2><a9> 2016, The Author(s).

PY  - 2015
AB  - Visual perception by individuals with schizophrenia has not been extensively researched. The focus of this review is the perception of physiological visual illusions by patients with schizophrenia, a differences of perception reported in a small number of studies. Increased or decreased susceptibility of these patients to various illusions seems to be unconnected to the location of origin in the visual apparatus, which also takes place in illusions connected to other modalities. The susceptibility of patients with schizophrenia to haptic illusions has not yet been investigated, although the need for such investigation has been is clear. The emerging picture is that some individuals with schizophrenia are "resistant" to some of the illusions and are able to assess visual phenomena more "rationally", yet certain illusions (ex. Muller-Lyer's) are perceived more intensely. Disturbances in the perception of visual illusions have neither been classified as possible diagnostic indicators of a dangerous mental condition, nor included in the endophenotype of schizophrenia. Although the relevant data are sparse, the ability to replicate the results is limited, and the research model lacks a "gold standard", some preliminary conclusions may be drawn. There are indications that disturbances in visual perception are connected to the extent of disorganization, poor initial social functioning, poor prognosis, and the types of schizophrenia described as neurodevelopmental. Patients with schizophrenia usually fail to perceive those illusions that require volitional controlled attention, and show lack of sensitivity to the contrast between shape and background.

AB  - Background: Patients with schizophrenia show overconfidence in memory and social cognition errors. The present investigation examined whether this cognitive distortion also manifests in perceptual tasks. Method(s): A total of 55 individuals with schizophrenia, 58 with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as well as 45 non-clinical controls were presented 24 blurry black and white pictures, half of which contained a hidden object; the other half contained ("snowy") visual noise. Participants had to judge whether the pictures depicted an object or not and how confident they were in this judgment. Result(s): Participants with schizophrenia showed overconfidence in errors and an enhanced knowledge corruption index (i.e. rate of high-confident errors on all high-confident responses) relative to both control groups. In contrast, accuracy scores did not differ between clinical groups. Metacognitive parameters were correlated with self-rated levels of current paranoia. Discussion(s): To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate overconfidence in errors among individuals with psychosis using a visual perception task. Speaking to the specificity of this abnormality for schizophrenia and its pathogenetic relevance, overconfidence in errors and knowledge corruption were elevated in patients with schizophrenia relative to both control groups and were correlated with paranoia.Copyright <c2><a9> 2014 The Authors.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Illusion, namely a mismatch between the objective and perceived properties of an object present in the environment, is a common feature of visual perception, both in normal and pathological conditions. This makes illusion a valuable tool with which to explore normal perception and its impairments. Although still debated, the hypothesis of a modified, and typically diminished, susceptibility to illusions in schizophrenia patients is supported by a growing number of studies. The current paper aimed to review how illusions have been used to explore and reveal the core features of visual perception in schizophrenia from a psychophysical, neurophysiological and functional point of view. We propose an integration of these findings into a common hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. The Bayesian formalism considers perception as the optimal combination between sensory evidence and prior knowledge, thereby highlighting the interweaving of perceptions and beliefs. Notably, it offers a holistic and convincing explanation for the perceptual changes observed in schizophrenia that might be ideally tested using illusory paradigms, as well as potential paths to explore neural mechanisms. Implications for psychopathology (in terms of positive symptoms, subjective experience or behavior disruptions) are critically discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Distinct synaptic mechanisms create parallel S-ON and S-OFF color opponent pathways in the primate retina

PY  - 2014
AB  - Anatomical and physiological approaches are beginning to reveal the synaptic origins of parallel ON- and OFF-pathway retinal circuits for the transmission of short (S-) wavelength sensitive cone signals in the primate retina. Anatomical data suggest that synaptic output from S-cones is largely segregated; central elements of synaptic triads arise almost exclusively from the "blue-cone" bipolar cell, a presumed ON bipolar, whereas triad-associated contacts derive primarily from the "flat" midget bipolar cell, a hyperpolarizing, OFF bipolar. Similarly, horizontal cell connectivity is also segregated, with only the H2 cell-type receiving numerous contacts from S-cones. Negative feedback from long (L-) and middle (M-) wavelength sensitive cones via the H2 horizontal cells elicits an antagonistic surround in S-cones demonstrating that S versus L + M or "blue-yellow" opponency is first established in the S-cone. However, the S-cone output utilizes distinct synaptic mechanisms to create color opponency at the ganglion cell level. The blue-cone bipolar cell is presynaptic to the small bistratified, "blue-ON" ganglion cell. S versus L + M cone opponency arises postsynaptically by converging S-ON and LM-OFF excitatory bipolar inputs to the ganglion cell's bistratified dendritic tree. The common L + M cone surrounds of the parallel S-ON and LM-OFF cone bipolar inputs appear to cancel resulting in "blue-yellow" antagonism without center-surround spatial opponency. By contrast, in midget ganglion cells, opponency arises by the differential weighting of cone inputs to the receptive field center versus surround. In the macula, the "private-line" connection from a midget ganglion cell to a single cone predicts that S versus L + M opponency is transmitted from the S-cone to the S-OFF midget bipolar and ganglion cell. Beyond the macula, OFF-midget ganglion cell dendritic trees enlarge and collect additional input from multiple L and M cones. Thus S-OFF opponency via the midget pathway would be expected to become more complex in the near retinal periphery as L and/or M and S cone inputs sum to the receptive field center. An important goal for further investigation will be to explore the hypothesis that distinct bistratified S-ON versus midget S-OFF retinal circuits are the substrates for human psychophysical detection mechanisms attributed to S-ON versus S-OFF perceptual channels.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the spatial resolution of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) response to subretinal stimulation with photovoltaic arrays. Method(s): Photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes of 70 and 140pm were placed on the photoreceptor side of normally-sighted (Long Evans, LE) and degenerate (Royal College of Surgeons, RCS) rat retinas, while network-meDiated responses were recorded from the RGCs using a 512 channel multielectrode array. A sparse white noise pattern was projected on the prosthesis using 880nm light to measure the electrical receptive fields (eRFs) of inDividual neurons. A visible white noise stimulus was used to measure the natural receptive fields (RFs) of the same neurons. Spatial resolution was also evaluated by reversing the contrast of linear gratings of various spatial frequencies at 2Hz. Result(s): With 140pm photoDiode pixels, the mean eRF Diameter in LE retinas was 535 +/- 153pm. With 70pm pixels, approximately 90% of the RGCs had localized eRFs with a mean Diameter of 248 +/- 59pm, comparable to the mean RF of the same neurons, 249 +/- 44pm. The remaining 10% of RGCs exhibited a center-surround response structure, with strong localized stimulation in the center of the eRF and lower amplitude, Diffuse stimulation over a surround that could spread over a circular area of 490-560pm Diameter . With 70pm pixels in RCS rats, the mean eRF Diameter was 205 +/- 69pm. For RCS rat retinas stimulated by 70pm pixels, inDividual RGCs responded to contrast reversal of the 140pm stripes and Did not respond to 35pm grating stripes. Conclusion(s): The average size of RGC eRFs obtained with a photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis, having 70pm bipolar pixels, is similar to the average size of natural RFs in the rat retina, and average eRF Diameter doubles when pixel size increases from 70 to 140um. The average size of eRFs in degenerate retina (RCS) is similar to that in the WT retina. 70 pm bipolar pixels can sometimes elicit center-surround responses, with center and surround having Different latencies. Initial results inDicate that the 70pm implant can resolve gratings with stripes smaller than 140pm, and larger than 35pm .

AB  - BackgroundImpaired facial affect recognition is the most consistent social cognitive finding in schizophrenia. Although social situations provide powerful constraints on our perception, little is known about how situational context modulates facial affect recognition in schizophrenia.MethodsStudy 1 was a single-site study with 34 schizophrenia patients and 22 healthy controls. Study 2 was a 2-site study with 68 schizophrenia patients and 28 controls. Both studies administered a Situational Context Facial Affect Recognition Task with 2 conditions: a situational context condition and a no-context condition. For the situational context condition, a briefly shown face was preceded by a sentence describing either a fear-or surprise-inducing event. In the no-context condition, a face was presented without a sentence. For both conditions, subjects rated how fearful or surprised the face appeared on a 9-point Likert scale.ResultsFor the situational context condition of study 1, both patients and controls rated faces as more afraid when they were paired with fear-inducing sentences and as more surprised when they were paired with surprise-inducing sentences. The degree of modulation was comparable across groups. For the no-context condition, patients rated faces comparably to controls. The findings of study 2 replicated those from study 1.ConclusionsDespite previous abnormalities in other types of context paradigms, this study found intact situational context processing in schizophrenia, suggesting that patients benefit from situational context when interpreting ambiguous facial expression. This area of relative social cognitive strength in schizophrenia has implications for social cognitive training programs. <c2><a9> 2012 The Author.

AB  - Perception has been identified by the NIMH-sponsored Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) group as a useful domain for assessing cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia. Specific measures of contrast gain derived from recordings of steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEP) have demonstrated neural deficits within the visual pathways of patients with schizophrenia. Psychophysical measures of contrast sensitivity have also shown functional loss in these patients. In the current study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used in conjunction with ssVEP and contrast sensitivity testing to elucidate the neural underpinnings of these deficits. During fMRI scanning, participants viewed 1) the same low and higher spatial frequency stimuli used in the psychophysical contrast sensitivity task, at both individual detection threshold contrast and at a high contrast; and 2) the same stimuli used in the ssVEP paradigm, which were designed to be biased toward either the magnocellular or parvocellular visual pathway. Patients showed significant impairment in contrast sensitivity at both spatial frequencies in the psychophysical task, but showed reduced occipital activation volume for low, but not higher, spatial frequency at the low and high contrasts tested in the magnet. As expected, patients exhibited selective deficits under the magnocellular-biased ssVEP condition. However, occipital lobe fMRI responses demonstrated the same general pattern for magnocellular- and parvocellular-biased stimuli across groups. These results indicate dissociation between the fMRI measures and the psychophysical/ssVEP measures. These latter measures appear to have greater value for the functional assessment of the contrast deficits explored here. <c2><a9> 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Photons do collapse in the retina not in the brain cortex: Evidence from visual illusions
AU  - Georgiev D.
PY  - 2011
AB  - While looking for evidence of quantum coherent states within the brain, many quantum mind advocates proposed experiments based on the assumption that the coherent state of a photon entering the visual system could somehow be preserved through the neural processing, or in other words they suppose that photons collapse not in the retina, but in the brain cortex. In this paper we show that photons do collapse within the retina and subsequent processing of information at the level of neural membranes proceeds. Moreover, we explicitly stress on the fact that due to existent amplification of the signal produced by each photon, a basic quantum mechanical theorem forbids the photon state to be teleported from the retina to the brain cortex. The changes of the membrane potential of the neurons in the primary visual cortex are shown to be relevant to inputting visual sensory information that is already processed and is not identical to the visual image entering in the retina. A striking evidence for the existent processing of the incoming visual information by the retina is provided by visual illusions resulting from the lateral inhibition mechanism.

AB  - Room tilt illusion, a misperception that the entire room is tilted, is a rare but nonspecific neurological symptom. We report a patient with Parkinson's disease who developed typical room tilt illusion. Single photon emission computed tomography demonstrated hypoperfusion of the posterior area of the right intraparietal sulcus, which is related to discriminating the surface orientation of three-dimensional objects. Therefore, it is possible that dysfunction of this region of the intraparietal sulcus may have disrupted the integration of spatial reference frames for internal representation of the surrounding space in our patient, and thus may have caused room tilt illusion. <c2><a9> 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - nAChR agonist-induced cognition enhancement: Integration of cognitive and neuronal mechanisms
AU  - Sarter M.
AU  - Parikh V.
AU  - Howe W.M.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The identification and characterization of drugs for the treatment of cognitive disorders has been hampered by the absence of comprehensive hypotheses. Such hypotheses consist of (a) a precisely defined cognitive operation that fundamentally underlies a range of cognitive abilities and capacities and, if impaired, contributes to the manifestation of diverse cognitive symptoms; (b) defined neuronal mechanisms proposed to mediate the cognitive operation of interest; (c) evidence indicating that the putative cognition enhancer facilitates these neuronal mechanisms; (d) and evidence indicating that the cognition enhancer facilitates cognitive performance by modulating these underlying neuronal mechanisms. The evidence on the neuronal and attentional effects of nAChR agonists, specifically agonists selective for alpha4beta2* nAChRs, has begun to support such a hypothesis. nAChR agonists facilitate the detection of signals by augmenting the transient increases in prefrontal cholinergic activity that are necessary for a signal to gain control over behavior in attentional contexts. The prefrontal microcircuitry mediating these effects include alpha4beta2* nAChRs situated on the terminals of thalamic inputs and the glutamatergic stimulation of cholinergic terminals via ionotropic glutamate receptors. Collectively, this evidence forms the basis for hypothesis-guided development and characterization of cognition enhancers. <c2><a9> 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2008
AB  - Objective: Obesity in severely mentally ill (SMI) populations is an increasing problem, but there is no controlled data regarding the relationship between SMI and weight perception. Method(s): Fifty patients with schizophrenia and 50 demographically matched control participants were recruited. Weight, height, and body image accuracy were assessed for all participants, and assessments of mood, psychotic symptom severity and anxiety, and preferred modes of weight loss were assessed for the schizophrenia sample. Result(s): Patients with schizophrenia were significantly more likely to be obese than controls (46% vs. 18%, P < 0.005), and most patients expressed an interest in losing weight. Obese participants with schizophrenia underestimated their body size (11.0%) more than controls (4.9%) (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Patients with schizophrenia are more likely to underestimate their body size, independent of the effects of obesity. However, they also express concern about weight issues and willingness to participate in psychoeducational groups targeted at weight loss.

TI  - Normal electrocortical facilitation but abnormal target identification during visual sustained attention in schizophrenia
AU  - Clementz B.A.

AU  - Keil A.
PY  - 2008
AB  - Attentional deficits in schizophrenia have been investigated using target identification tasks which conflate the abilities to successfully (1) attend to possible target locations and (2) detect target events. Whether compromised attentional selectivity or abnormal target detection causes schizophrenia subjects' poor performance on visual attention tasks, therefore, is unknown. To address this issue, we measured the neural activity (using electroencephalography) of 17 schizophrenia and 17 healthy subjects during a target identification task. Participants viewed superimposed images (horizontal and vertical bars differing in color) and attended to one image to identify bar width changes in specific locations. Bars were frequency tagged so attention directed to unique parts of the images could be tracked. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) were used to quantify attention-related neural activity to specific parts of the visual images. Behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to the target events were used to quantify target detection abilities. For both schizophrenia and healthy subjects, attending to specific parts of the attended image enhanced brain activity related to attended bars and reduced activity evoked by unattended bars. Activity in relation to the spatially overlapping unattended image was unaffected. Schizophrenia patients, however, were impaired on target detection abilities on both behavioral and brain activity measures. Target-related behavioral and brain activity measures were highly correlated in both groups. These findings indicate that deficient target detection rather than compromised attentional selectivity accounts for previously reported visual attention deficits in schizophrenia.

TI  - Dopamine D3 receptor ligands-Recent advances in the control of subtype selectivity and intrinsic activity
AU  - Boeckler F.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Various pharmacological studies have implicated the dopamine D3 receptor as an interesting therapeutic target in the treatment of different neurological disorders. Because of these putative therapeutic applications, D3 receptor ligands with diverse intrinsic activities have been an active field of research in recent years. Separation of purely D3-mediated drug effects from effects produced by interactions with similar biogenic amine receptors allows to verify the therapeutic impact of D3 receptors and to reduce possible side-effects caused by "promiscuous" receptor interactions. The requirement to gain control of receptor selectivity and in particular subtype selectivity has been a challenging task in rational drug discovery for quite a few years. In this review, recently developed structural classes of D3 ligands are discussed, which cover a broad spectrum of intrinsic activities and show interesting selectivities. <c2><a9> 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The impact of photoreceptor noise on retinal gain controls
AU  - Dunn F.A.
AU  - Rieke F.
PY  - 2006
AB  - Multiple retinal mechanisms preserve visual sensitivity as the properties of the light inputs change. Rapid gain controls match the effective signaling range of retinal neurons to the local image statistics. Such gain controls trade an increased sensitivity for some aspects of the inputs for a decreased sensitivity to others. Rapid, local gain control comes at another cost: noise in the signal controlling gain (e.g. from the photoreceptors) will cause gain itself to vary even when the statistics of the light input are constant. Recent advances in identifying retinal pathways and the sites and mechanisms of mean and contrast adaptation have begun to clarify the tradeoffs associated with different gain control locations and how these tradeoffs differ for rod and cone vision. <c2><a9> 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The involvement of glutamate-gated channels in negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones
AU  - Fahrenfort I.

AU  - Sjoerdsma T.
AU  - Kamermans M.
PY  - 2005
AB  - Photoreceptors are the light sensitive cells in the retina. They project to horizontal cells and bipolar cells via a glutamatergic feed forward pathway. Horizontal cells are strongly electrically coupled and integrate in that way the input from the photoreceptors. Horizontal cells feedback to cones negatively. The combined signal from the photoreceptors and the horizontal cells is sent to the bipolar cells. The feedback pathway from horizontal cells to cones is thought to form the basis for the center/surround organization of bipolar cells. The nature of the feedback pathway is an issue of intense debate. It was thought for a long time that this feedback pathway was GABAergic, because cones have GABA-receptors and horizontal cells release GABA via a GABA-transporter working in the reversed direction. However, recently we showed in goldfish that horizontal cells feed back to cones via an alternative mechanism. In goldfish, negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones shifts the calcium current of the cone to more negative potentials. This feedback pathway is independent of GABA, since feedback cannot be blocked by either saturating concentrations of PTX, the GABA-transporter blocker SKF89976A, or application of GABA. The mechanism of negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones involves hemichannels located at the tips of the invaginating horizontal cells, just opposite to the calcium channels of the cones. Current flowing through these hemichannels changes the extracellular potential deep in the synaptic cleft and in that way modulates the calcium current of the cones. Such a modulation of the extracellular potential is called ephaptic. If negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones is indeed ephaptic, other channels present in the synapse should also be able to act as a current source, i.e., should also be able to change the output of the cone. We showed that glutamate-gated channels present at the tips of the horizontal cell dendrites can also mediate feedback responses. Surprisingly, although the glutamate-gated conductance of the horizontal cells is eight times the hemichannel conductance, glutamate-gated channels are not the major current source in negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones. In this chapter we present evidence that this is due to the more focal localization of the hemichannels, compared to a diffuse and extrasynaptic localization of the glutamate-gated channels.

AB  - Phillips & Silverstein argue that schizophrenia is a result of a deficit of the contextual coordination of Deuronal responses. The authors propose that NMDA-receptors control these modulatory effects. However, hallucinations, which are among the principle symptoms of schizophrenia, imply a flaw in the interactions between neurons that is more fundamental than just a general weakness of contextual modulation.

AB  - The syndrome of Alice in Wonderland denotes a variety of self-experienced paroxysmal body schema disturbances which may co-occur with depersonalization, derealization, visual illusions and disorders of time perception. A case report of a female migraine sufferer who both described and illustrated her Alice in Wonderland experiences is presented. The phenomenological similarities between the Alice in Wonderland syndrome occurring as migraine aura and the cenesthesias and cognitive perceptual disturbances encountered in idiopathic schizophrenic psychoses support the notion of an organic etiology of the last mentioned symptoms, as postulated in Huber's concept of basic symptoms of functional psychoses.

PY  - 1997
AB  - A 28-year-old man survived midbrain trauma. A diurnally varying dystonia-parkinsonism-delirium-panic syndrome emerged after 1 year. Auditory hallucinations were also associated with dystonia and may relate to tegmental pathology. This patient also manifested panic attacks independent of dystonia, visual illusions resembling post-hallucinogen perceptions, paranoia, bipolar mood disturbance, compulsions, generalized anxiety (GA), dystonia and parkinsonism independent of delirium and panic, and myoclonus. Neuropsychological findings are also presented. The conditions are discussed in relation to midbrain structures and clinical management. These disorders may relate to pathology of midbrain structures and tracts pertaining to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, cerebellum, reticular formation, and peripheral sensation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) improved bipolar disorder, paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA but low-dose CBZ actually exacerbated GA. Trihexyphenidyl (THP) improved dystonia and parkinsonism but worsened paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA. THP improved dystonic frequency before reducing dystonic severity. Paroxetine improved illusions and dystonia but seemed to precipitate panic attacks. Illusions resembled palinopsia and post-hallucinogen perceptual disorder and may relate to reduced stimulation of 5HT2 serotonin receptors. Careful clinical vigilance and planning are indicated when treating patients with midbrain pathology.

TI  - Alcoholism
AU  - Bohn M.J.
PY  - 1993
AB  - Alcoholism is a heterogeneous disorder with complex patterns of progression. Medications are likely to play a significant role in treatment of a subgroup of patients with alcohol abuse or dependence. Their appropriate integration into alcoholism treatment may improve patient outcomes when combined with psychosocial treatments. Benzodiazepines have a central and potentially life-saving role in treatment of uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal, and in preventing the development of withdrawal of seizures and delirium. The judicious addition of a beta blocker such as atenolol, the alpha adrenergic agonist clonidine, and thiamine, other vitamins, and electrolytes may improve treatment of severe withdrawal. These medications also may facilitate outpatient detoxification of less severely dependent alcoholics, particularly when combined with good supportive care. Following detoxification, drugs that diminish the urge to drink or the likelihood of heavy drinking may be useful when combined with a variety of psychosocial treatments for alcoholism, particularly relapse prevention therapies that use cognitive and behavioral techniques, or self-help groups, such as AA. The opioid antagonist naltrexone and the serotonergic agents fluoxetine and buspirone appear useful for the patients at this phase in treatment. The alcohol sensitizing agents disulfiram and carbimide may be effective to deter frequent drinking in compliant patients, particularly when used in a supportive, abstinence-oriented treatment program. Physicians working with patients involved in AA groups may find this mode of pharmacotherapy particularly well accepted and effective, provided that a proper drug dose is used and the patient is informed of toxic effects, which can be monitored. Self-help groups can help the patient improve compliance and assist the alcoholic gain control over his or her drinking. The physician needs to assess and treat persistent depressive, psychotic, panic, and anxiety symptoms. In addition, the patient family members, AA sponsors, and others need to be educated that such psychiatric disorders can be treated effectively with pharmacotherapy in ways that complement, rather than compete with, other treatments for alcoholism. Successful psychosocial rehabilitation of alcoholism is influenced substantially by a variety of coexisting psychiatric disorders, including depression and antisocial personality disorder. Nonpharmacologic treatments for alcoholism can be improved by carefully matching specific treatment types with specific patient types, including coexisting psychopathology. Relapse prevention skills training produced superior alcoholism treatment outcomes among a subtype of alcoholics with early onset of alcoholic problems, more sociopathy, and psychologic disturbance. In contrast, interactional psychotherapy was more effective for a second subtype of alcoholic who had less sociopathy, less psychologic disturbance, and later onset of alcoholism. Further improvements in alcoholism treatment can be expected if particular patient types can be identified based on their likelihood to benefit from particular combinations of medications and psychosocial treatment methods.

AB  - Closed-eye visual hallucinations are rare and poorly understood isolated visualizations that emerge after eye closure. Here, we report a case of highly complex closed-eye visual hallucinations associated with clarithromycin.However, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of closed-eye visual hallucinations emerging in the context of clarithromycin use. Through suppression of endogenous GABA-ergic signaling, we hypothesized that clarithromycin may predispose to visual-release phenomena in susceptible individuals. A woman in her eighties was in her usual state of health until 2 days after being started on clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily) for treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Reductions in GABA-ergic signaling and relative imbalances with excitatory glutaminergic signaling have been linked to a range of other perceptual disturbances, including deficits in orientation specific surround suppression in the context of schizophrenia and deficits in visual contrast perception.

TI  - Antagonistic surround responses in different cones are mediated by feedback synapses from different horizontal cells

AB  - Cone photoreceptors are the first neurons along the visual pathway that exhibit center-surround antagonistic receptive fields, the basic building blocks for spatial information processing in the visual system. The surround responses in cones are mediated by the horizontal cells (HCs) via multiple feedback synaptic mechanisms. It has been controversial on which mechanisms are responsible for the surround-elicited depolarizing responses in cones (DELTAVCone(s)), and whether the surround responses of various types of cones are mediated by the same HC feedback mechanisms. In this report, we studied DELTAVCone(s)) of four types of cones in the salamander retina, and found that they are mediated by feedback synapses from A-type, B-type or A- and B-type HCs. DELTAVCone(s) are observable in the presence of concomitant center light spots, and surround + center light stimuli of various intensity, size and wavelength differentially activate the feedback synapses from A- and B-type HCs to cones. We found that DELTAVCone(s) of the L-cones are mediated by both A- and B-type HCs, those of the P- and S-cones by B-type HCs, and those of the A-cones by the A-type HCs. Moreover, our results suggest that B-type HCs mediate DELTAVCone(s) through both GABAergic and GluT-ClC feedback synaptic mechanisms, and A-type HCs mediate DELTAVCone(s) via the GluT-ClC feedback mechanism. Feedback synaptic mechanisms that increase calcium influx in cone synaptic terminals play important roles in mediating the antagonistic surround responses in the postsynaptic bipolar cells, but they may not generate enough current to depolarize the cones and significantly contribute to DELTAVCone(s).

TI  - Inhibitory components of retinal bipolar cell receptive fields are differentially modulated by dopamine D1 receptors
AU  - Mazade, Reece E
AU  - Eggers, Erika D
PY  - 2020
AB  - During adaptation to an increase in environmental luminance, retinal signaling adjustments are mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine. Retinal dopamine is released with light and can affect center-surround receptive fields, the coupling state between neurons, and inhibitory pathways through inhibitory receptors and neurotransmitter release. While the inhibitory receptive field surround of bipolar cells becomes narrower and weaker during light adaptation, it is unknown how dopamine affects bipolar cell surrounds. If dopamine and light have similar effects, it would suggest that dopamine could be a mechanism for light-adapted changes. We tested the hypothesis that dopamine D1 receptor activation is sufficient to elicit the magnitude of light-adapted reductions in inhibitory bipolar cell surrounds. Surrounds were measured from OFF bipolar cells in dark-adapted mouse retinas while stimulating D1 receptors, which are located on bipolar, horizontal, and inhibitory amacrine cells. The D1 agonist SKF-38393 narrowed and weakened OFF bipolar cell inhibitory receptive fields but not to the same extent as with light adaptation. However, the receptive field surround reductions differed between the glycinergic and GABAergic components of the receptive field. GABAergic inhibitory strength was reduced only at the edges of the surround, while glycinergic inhibitory strength was reduced across the whole receptive field. These results expand the role of retinal dopamine to include modulation of bipolar cell receptive field surrounds. Additionally, our results suggest that D1 receptor pathways may be a mechanism for the light-adapted weakening of glycinergic surround inputs and the furthest wide-field GABAergic inputs to bipolar cells. However, remaining differences between light-adapted and D1 receptor-activated inhibition demonstrate that non-D1 receptor mechanisms are necessary to elicit the full effect of light adaptation on inhibitory surrounds.

AB  - Our ability to integrate multiple sensory-based representations of our surrounding supplies us with a more holistic view of our world. There are many complex algorithms our nervous system uses to construct a coherent perception. An indicator to solve this 'binding problem' are the temporal characteristics with the specificity that environmental information has different propagation speeds (e.g., sound and electromagnetic waves) and sensory processing time and thus the temporal relationship of a stimulus pair derived from the same event must be flexibly adjusted by our brain. This tolerance can be conceptualized in the form of the cross-modal temporal binding window (TBW). Several studies showed the plasticity of the TBW and its importance concerning audio-visual illusions, synesthesia, as well as psychiatric disturbances. Using three audio-visual paradigms, we investigated the importance of length (short vs. long) as well as modality (uni- vs. multimodal) of a perceptual training aiming at reducing the TBW in a healthy population. We also investigated the influence of the TBW on speech intelligibility, where participants had to integrate auditory and visual speech information from a videotaped speaker. We showed that simple sensory trainings can change the TBW and are capable of optimizing speech perception at a very naturalistic level. While the training-length had no different effect on the malleability of the TBW, the multisensory trainings induced a significantly stronger narrowing of the TBW than their unisensory counterparts. Furthermore, a narrowing of the TBW was associated with a better performance in speech perception, meaning that participants showed a greater capacity for integrating informations from different sensory modalities in situations with one modality impaired. All effects persisted at least seven days. Our findings show the significance of multisensory temporal processing regarding ecologically valid measures and have important clinical implications for interventions that may be used to alleviate debilitating conditions (e.g., autism, schizophrenia), in which multisensory temporal function is shown to be impaired.

The original article has been updated.] Compared to unaffected observers patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show characteristic differences in visual perception, including a reduced susceptibility to the influence of context on judgments of contrast-a manifestation of weaker surround suppression (SS). To examine the generality of this phenomenon we measured the ability of 24 individuals with SZ to judge the luminance, contrast, orientation, and size of targets embedded in contextual surrounds that would typically influence the target's appearance. Individuals with SZ demonstrated weaker SS compared to matched controls for stimuli defined by contrast or size, but not for those defined by luminance or orientation. As perceived luminance is thought to be regulated at the earliest stages of visual processing our findings are consistent with a suppression deficit that is predominantly cortical in origin. In addition, we propose that preserved orientation SS in SZ may reflect the sparing of broadly tuned mechanisms of suppression. We attempt to reconcile these data with findings from previous studies.

AB  - Presents a study which aims to examine qualitatively patient experience when switching from paliperidone palmitate once monthly (PP1M) to paliperidone palmitate three monthly (PP3M) long-acting injectable antipsychotic. All patients were open to change from PP1M to PP3M after explaining that the medication contains the same active molecule and that it requires less frequent injections. The most common adverse events reported were weight gain, headaches, decreased libido and restlessness, however these tended to be very mild, did not worsen opinion of PP3M, and most resolved within a few weeks or were managed with dose reduction. The one patient who did not continue PP3M, switched back to PP1M due to increased episodes of breakthrough hallucinations. Another patient changed to Q11 weeks to minimize breakthrough psychosis. The authors interviewed 14 patients who underwent this change, and all reported positive or neutral perceptions. Changing to a 3-month injection allowed patients to gain control and have less reminders of having an illness. Not only was it more convenient for staff and patients, it promoted adherence to medication. Once stabilized on PP1M, our results should encourage healthcare providers and patients to consider PP3M as a better option for most. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Shergill, Emilio Fernandez-Egea, Geraint Rees and Steven C. Dakin (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2017[Feb][8], Vol 37[6], 1546-1556). In the original article, there is an error in Figure 2, where the labels at the bottom of the two columns have been incorrectly switched. The correct labels are shown in the figure presented in the erratum and corrected on the online PDF version. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-23376-018). People with schizophrenia (SZ) experience abnormal visual perception on a range of visual tasks, which have been linked to abnormal synaptic transmission and an imbalance between cortical excitation and inhibition. However, differences in the underlying architecture of visual cortex neurons, which might explain these visual anomalies, have yet to be reported in vivo. Here, we probed the neural basis of these deficits using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) mapping to infer properties of visually responsive neurons in people with SZ. We employed a difference-of-Gaussian model to capture the center-surround configuration of the pRF, providing critical information about the spatial scale of the pRFs inhibitory surround. Our analysis reveals that SZ is associated with reduced pRF size in early retinotopic visual cortex, as well as a reduction in size and depth of the inhibitory surround in V1, V2, and V4. We consider how reduced inhibition might explain the diverse range of visual deficits reported in SZ. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Our view is that insomnia may be a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences such as paranoia and hallucinations. However, the causal relationship is not established. The aim of the study was to investigate the causal role of insomnia in psychotic experiences via a sleep restriction manipulation. The study was a within-subjects crossover design that included a planned mediation analysis. Sixty-eight nonclinical volunteers underwent a sleep loss condition (restricted to 4 h sleep for 3 nights) and a control condition (standard sleep) in randomized order in 2 consecutive weeks, with a weekend washout period. Psychotic experiences (paranoia, hallucinations, grandiosity, and cognitive disorganization) and candidate mediating variables (negative affect and related processes, working memory, decision making, and perceptual processing) were assessed before and after each condition. Actigraphy verified an average sleep duration of 5 h 15 min in the sleep loss condition, vs 6 h 58 min in the control condition. After the sleep loss condition, relative to the control condition, participants reported significant increases in paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive disorganization, with no significant changes in grandiosity. The sleep loss condition was also associated with significant increases in negative affect, negative self and other cognitions, worry, and working memory impairment. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in psychotic experiences were mediated by changes in negative affect and related processes, but not memory impairment. The overall conclusion is that insomnia has a causal role in the occurrence of certain psychotic experiences, and that a key route is via negative affect.

AB  - In the mammalian retina, horizontal cells receive glutamatergic inputs from many rod and cone photoreceptors and return feedback signals to them, thereby changing photoreceptor glutamate release in a light-dependent manner. Horizontal cells also provide feedforward signals to bipolar cells. It is unclear, however, how horizontal cell signals also affect the temporal, spatial, and contrast tuning in retinal output neurons, the ganglion cells. To study this, we generated a genetically modified mouse line in which we eliminated the light dependency of feedback by deleting glutamate receptors from mouse horizontal cells. This genetic modification allowed us to investigate the impact of horizontal cells on ganglion cell signaling independent of the actual mode of feedback in the outer retina and without pharmacological manipulation of signal transmission. In control and genetically modified mice (both sexes), we recorded the light responses of transient OFF-alpha retinal ganglion cells in the intact retina. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were reduced and the cells were tuned to lower temporal frequencies and higher contrasts, presumably because photoreceptor output was attenuated. Moreover, receptive fields of recorded cells showed a significantly altered surround structure. Our data thus suggest that horizontal cells are responsible for adjusting the dynamic range of retinal ganglion cells and, together with amacrine cells, contribute to the center/surround organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the mouse.

TI  - Light adaptation alters inner retinal inhibition to shape OFF retinal pathway signaling
AU  - Mazade, Reece E
AU  - Eggers, Erika D
PY  - 2016
AB  - The retina adjusts its signaling gain over a wide range of light levels. A functional result of this is increased visual acuity at brighter luminance levels (light adaptation) due to shifts in the excitatory center-inhibitory surround receptive field parameters of ganglion cells that increases their sensitivity to smaller light stimuli. Recent work supports the idea that changes in ganglion cell spatial sensitivity with background luminance are due in part to inner retinal mechanisms, possibly including modulation of inhibition onto bipolar cells. To determine how the receptive fields of OFF cone bipolar cells may contribute to changes in ganglion cell resolution, the spatial extent and magnitude of inhibitory and excitatory inputs were measured from OFF bipolar cells under dark- and light-adapted conditions. There was no change in the OFF bipolar cell excitatory input with light adaptation; however, the spatial distributions of inhibitory inputs, including both glycinergic and GABAergic sources, became significantly narrower, smaller, and more transient. The magnitude and size of the OFF bipolar cell center-surround receptive fields as well as light-adapted changes in resting membrane potential were incorporated into a spatial model of OFF bipolar cell output to the downstream ganglion cells, which predicted an increase in signal output strength with light adaptation. We show a prominent role for inner retinal spatial signals in modulating the modeled strength of bipolar cell output to potentially play a role in ganglion cell visual sensitivity and acuity.

She had received both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs for more than 10 years. These drugs were not well tolerated because of extrapyramidal side effects. Recently, she had been prescribed paliperidone, 6 mg/d, with significant remission of her symptoms. Since this new therapy was introduced, the patient experienced frequent attacks of visual illusions. These attacks were characterized by small dark spots overlapping with the objects present in the visual field, sometimes associated with hyperchromatopsia, rosopometamorphopsia, and distortion of contours, accompanied by intense photophobia and severe anxiety. These recurrent attacks were not associated nor followed by alteration of consciousness or headache. Approximately one-half of the episodes were associated with oculogyric crises, with uncontrolled eye blinking, followed by upward eye deviation. Neurologic examination, laboratory tests, computerized visual field testing, ictal and interictal electroencephalography, and brain MRI were normal. Therefore, a diagnosis of paroxysmal perceptual alteration (PPA) was made. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - GlyRalpha2, not GlyRalpha3, modulates the receptive field surround of OFF retinal ganglion cells
AU  - Zhang, Chi

PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract Receptive fields (RFs) of most retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) consist of an excitatory center and suppressive surround. The RF center arises from the summation of excitatory bipolar cell glutamatergic inputs, whereas the surround arises from lateral inhibitory inputs. In the retina, both gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and glycine are inhibitory neurotransmitters. A clear role for GABAergic inhibition modulating the RGC RF surround has been demonstrated across species. Glycinergic inhibition is more commonly associated with RF center modulation, although there is some evidence that it may contribute to the RF surround. The synaptic glycinergic chloride channels are formed by three homomeric beta and two homomeric alpha subunits that can be glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, or alpha4. GlyRalpha composition is responsible for currents with distinct decay kinetics. Their expression within the inner plexiform laminae and neuronal subtypes also differ. We studied the role of GlyR subunit selective modulation of RGC RF surrounds, using mice lacking GlyRalpha2 (Glra2-/-), GlyRalpha3 (Glra3-/-), or both (Glra2/3-/-). We chose this molecular genetic approach instead of pharmacological manipulation because there are no subunit selective antagonists and strychnine blocks all GlyRs. Comparisons of annulus-evoked responses among wild type (WT) and GlyRalpha knockouts (Glra2-/-, Glra3-/- and Glra2/3-/-) show that GlyRalpha2 inhibition enhances RF surround suppression and post-stimulus excitation in only WT OFF RGCs. Similarities in the responses in Glra2-/- and Glra2/3-/- RGCs verify these conclusions. Based on previous and current data, we propose that GlyRalpha2-mediated input uses a crossover inhibitory circuit. Further, we suggest that GlyRalpha2 modulates the OFF RGC RF center and surround independently. In summary, our results define a selective GlyR subunit-specific control of RF surround suppression in OFF RGCs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual processing in the retina depends on coordinated signaling by interneurons. Photoreceptor signals are relayed to ~20 ganglion cell types through a dozen excitatory bipolar interneurons, each responsive to light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF). ON and OFF bipolar cell pathways become tuned through specific connections with inhibitory interneurons: horizontal and amacrine cells. A major obstacle for understanding retinal circuitry is the unknown function of most of the ~30-40 amacrine cell types, each of which synapses onto a subset of bipolar cell terminals, ganglion cell dendrites, and other amacrine cells. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line in which vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) GABAergic interneurons express Cre recombinase. Targeted whole-cell recordings of fluorescently labeled VIP+ cells revealed three predominant types: wide-field bistratified and narrow-field monostratified cells with somas in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and medium-field monostratified cells with somas in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Bistratified INL cells integrated excitation and inhibition driven by bothONand OFF pathways with little spatial tuning. Narrow-field INL cells integrated excitation driven by the ON pathway and inhibition driven by both pathways, with pronounced hyperpolarizations at light offset. Monostratified GCL cells integrated excitation and inhibition driven by the ON pathway and showed center-surround spatial tuning. Optogenetic experiments showed that, collectively, VIP+cells made strong connections with OFFdelta, ON-OFF direction-selective, and W3 ganglion cells but weak, inconsistent connections with ON and OFFdelta cells. Revealing VIP+ cell morphologies, receptive fields and synaptic connections advances our understanding of their role in visual processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As all visual information is represented in the spatio-temporal dynamics of transmitter release from photoreceptors and the combined postsynaptic responses of second-order neurons, appropriate synaptic transfer functions are fundamental for a meaningful perception of the visual world. The functional contribution of horizontal cells to gain control and organization of bipolar and ganglion cell receptive fields can only be evaluated with an in-depth understanding of signal processing in horizontal cells. Therefore, a horizontal slice preparation of the mouse retina was established to record from horizontal cell bodies with their dendritic fields intact and receiving functional synaptic input from cone photoreceptors. Horizontal cell bodies showed spontaneous excitatory currents (spEPSCs) of monophasic and more complex multi-peak waveforms. spEPSCs were induced by quantal release of glutamate from presynaptic cones with a unitary amplitude of 3 pA. Non-stationary noise analysis revealed that spEPSCs with a monoexponential decay were mediated by 7-8 glutamate receptors with a single-channel amplitude of 1.55 pA. Responses to photopic full-field illumination were characterized by reduction of a tonic inward current or hyperpolarization, inhibition of spEPSCs, followed by a fast and transient inward current at light offset. The response to periodic dark/light transitions of different frequencies was dependent on the adaptational status of the cell with a limiting frequency of 10 Hz. Both on and off components of the light response were mediated by AMPA and kainate receptors. Detailed analysis of horizontal cell synaptic physiology is a prerequisite for understanding signal coding and processing at the photoreceptor ribbon synapse.

AB  - Horizontal cells in the mouse retina are of the axon-bearing B-type and contribute to the gain control of photoreceptors and to the center-surround organization of bipolar cells by providing feedback and feedforward signals to photoreceptors and bipolar cells, respectively. Horizontal cells form two independent networks, coupled by dendro-dendritic and axo-axonal gap junctions composed of connexin57 (Cx57). In Cx57-deficient mice, occasionally the residual tracer coupling of horizontal cell somata was observed. Also, negative feedback from horizontal cells to photoreceptors, potentially mediated by connexin hemichannels, appeared unaffected. These results point to the expression of a second connexin in mouse horizontal cells. We investigated the expression of Cx50, which was recently identified in axonless A-type horizontal cells of the rabbit retina. In the mouse retina, Cx50-immunoreactive puncta were predominantly localized on large axon terminals of horizontal cells. Electron microscopy did not reveal any Cx50-immunolabeling at the membrane of horizontal cell tips invaginating photoreceptor terminals, ruling out the involvement of Cx50 in negative feedback. Moreover, Cx50 colocalized only rarely with Cx57 on horizontal cell processes, indicating that both connexins form homotypic rather than heterotypic or heteromeric gap junctions. To check whether the expression of Cx50 is changed when Cx57 is lacking, we compared the Cx50 expression in wildtype and Cx57-deficient mice. However, Cx50 expression was unaffected in Cx57-deficient mice. In summary, our results indicate that horizontal cell axon terminals form two independent sets of homotypic gap junctions, a feature which might be important for light adaptation in the retina.

AU  - Smith, Benjamin J

PY  - 2015
AB  - In amphibians, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in cone ON bipolar cells (ON-CBC) amplify cone signals in the dark and in mesopic background light. However, during light adaptation, dopamine, acting through D1 receptors (D1R), suppresses Nav channels and therefore act as a gain control mechanism. Curiously in rodents, Nav channel contributions to the ON-CBC-generated light-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave appear to exist even in fully light-adapted conditions. We sought to determine how rodent ON-CBC Nav channels are regulated by dopamine via D1R during light adaptation and during the circadian cycle. We first tested the sensitivity of Nav channels in mouse ON-CBCs to the modulation by dopamine via D1Rs. Although light-adaptation had little effect on Nav channel contributions to the b-wave, these channels were found to be modulated by D1Rs. We pharmacologically isolated the cone to ON-CBC circuit in fully light-adapted retinas to confirm these results. Retinal dopamine release following light adaptation has been previously shown to be increased in mice during circadian night. We first show that circadian fluctuations in ON-CBC function are suppressed in dark-adapted retinas, indicating that circadian fluctuations are a function of light adaptation. Secondly, we show that at night the mouse retina behaves similarly to those of frogs and salamanders with a gain control mechanism utilizing D1R modulation of Nav channels to suppress ON-CBC light responses in light-adapted conditions during circadian night. Taken together, these results suggest that circadian control of ON-CBC function contains an initial phase after approximately 18-30 h of dark adaptation, leading to substantial changes in b-wave amplitude after a relatively short time in free run which are dependent on D1R modulation of Nav channels.

AB  - Visual perception in schizophrenia is attracting a broad interest given the deep knowledge that we have about the visual system in healthy populations. One example is the class of effects known collectively as visual surround suppression. For example, the visibility of a grating located in the visual periphery is impaired by the presence of a surrounding grating of the same spatial frequency and orientation. Previous studies have suggested abnormal visual surround suppression in patients with schizophrenia. Given that schizophrenia patients have cortical alterations including hypofunction of NMDA receptors and reduced concentration of GABA neurotransmitter, which affect lateral inhibitory connections, then they should be relatively better than controls at detecting visual stimuli that are usually suppressed. We tested this hypothesis by measuring contrast detection thresholds using a new stimulus configuration. We tested two groups: 21 schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy subjects. Thresholds were obtained using Bayesian staircases in a four-alternative forced-choice detection task where the target was a grating within a 3degree Butterworth window that appeared in one of four possible positions at 5degree eccentricity. We compared three conditions, (a) target with no-surround, (b) target embedded within a surrounding grating of 20degree diameter and 25% contrast with same spatial frequency and orthogonal orientation, and (c) target embedded within a surrounding grating with parallel (same) orientation. Previous results with healthy populations have shown that contrast thresholds are lower for orthogonal and no-surround (NS) conditions than for parallel surround (PS). The logratios between parallel and NS thresholds are used as an index quantifying visual surround suppression. Patients performed poorly compared to controls in the NS and orthogonal-surround conditions. However, they performed as well as controls when the surround was parallel, resulting in significantly lower suppression indices in patients. To examine whether the difference in suppression was driven by the lower NS thresholds for controls, we examined a matched subgroup of controls and patients, selected to have similar thresholds in the NS condition. Patients performed significantly better in the PS condition than controls. This analysis therefore indicates that a PS raised contrast thresholds less in patients than in controls. Our results support the hypothesis that inhibitory connections in early visual cortex are impaired in schizophrenia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To make up for delays in visual processing, retinal circuitry effectively predicts that a moving object will continue moving in a straight line, allowing retinal ganglion cells to anticipate the object's position. However, a sudden reversal of motion triggers a synchronous burst of firing from a large group of ganglion cells, possibly signaling a violation of the retina's orthopedic. To investigate the neural circuitry underlying this response, we used a combination of multielectrode array and whole-cell patch recordings to measure the responses of individual retinal ganglion cells in the tiger salamander to reversing stimuli. We found that different populations of ganglion cells were responsible for responding to the reversal of different kinds of objects, such as bright versus dark objects. Using pharmacology and designed stimuli, we concluded that ON and OFF bipolar cells both contributed to the reversal response, but that amacrine cells had, at best, a minor role. This allowed us to formulate an adaptive cascade model (ACM), similar to the one previously used to describe ganglion cell responses to motion onset. By incorporating the ON pathway into the ACM, we were able to reproduce the time-varying firing rate of fast OFF ganglion cells for all experimentally tested stimuli. Analysis of the ACM demonstrates that bipolar cell gain control is primarily responsible for generating the synchronized retinal response, as individual bipolar cells require a constant time delay before recovering from gain control.

AB  - A subgroup of people with schizophrenia is characterized by reduced organization in perception, thought, language, and motor functioning, and these impairments covary significantly. While this may reflect multiple expressions of an illness-related core processing impairment, it may also represent the extreme end of an organization-disorganization dimension that is found throughout the general population. In this view, disorganization is a modifying influence on illness expression. To obtain preliminary information on this hypothesis, we examined covariation of perceptual and cognitive organization in a non-patient sample. Subjects completed a battery of perceptual tasks with demonstrated sensitivity to schizophrenia and disorganization, and a battery of questionnaires examining cognitive organization. Our results indicated that level of perceptual organization ability, across multiple tasks, was associated with self-reported levels of cognitive organization on multiple measures. This is thus preliminary evidence for a common process affecting perceptual and cognitive organization in the general population, suggesting that disorganization may reflect a modifying influence mechanism, instead of an illness-related process, in schizophrenia.

TI  - A synaptic signature for ON- and OFF-center parasol ganglion cells of the primate retina
AU  - Crook, Joanna D
AU  - Packer, Orin S
AU  - Dacey, Dennis M
PY  - 2014
AB  - In the primate retina, parasol ganglion cells contribute to the primary visual pathway via the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus, display ON and OFF concentric receptive field structure, nonlinear spatial summation, and high achromatic temporal-contrast sensitivity. Parasol cells may be homologous to the alpha-Y cells of nonprimate mammals where evidence suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated synaptic excitation as well as glycinergic disinhibition play critical roles in contrast sensitivity, acting asymmetrically in OFF- but not ON-pathways. Here, light-evoked synaptic currents were recorded in the macaque monkey retina in vitro to examine the circuitry underlying parasol cell receptive field properties. Synaptic excitation in both ON and OFF types was mediated by NMDA as well as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors. The NMDA-mediated current-voltage relationship suggested high Mg2+ affinity such that at physiological potentials, NMDA receptors contributed ~20% of the total excitatory conductance evoked by moderate stimulus contrasts and temporal frequencies. Postsynaptic inhibition in both ON and OFF cells was dominated by a large glycinergic "crossover" conductance, with a relatively small contribution from GABAergic feedforward inhibition. However, crossover inhibition was largely rectified, greatly diminished at low stimulus contrasts, and did not contribute, via disinhibition, to contrast sensitivity. In addition, attenuation of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic inhibition left center-surround and Y-type receptive field structure and high temporal sensitivity fundamentally intact and clearly derived from modulation of excitatory bipolar cell output. Thus, the characteristic spatial and temporal-contrast sensitivity of the primate parasol cell arises presynaptically and is governed primarily by modulation of the large AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated excitatory conductance. Moreover, the negative feedback responsible for the receptive field surround must derive from a nonGABAergic mechanism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The relation between cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits and the Ebbinghaus size-illusion is mediated by judgment time
AU  - Bressan, Paola
AU  - Kramer, Peter
PY  - 2013
AB  - In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a circle surrounded by smaller circles is perceived as larger than an identical one surrounded by larger circles. The illusion is reportedly weaker in individuals with (disorganized) schizophrenia or schizotypy than in controls, a finding that has been interpreted as evidence that both schizophrenia and schizotypy involve reduced contextual integration. In support of this view, we show that the Ebbinghaus illusion also decreases, in the general population, with cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits (measured with both the cognitive-perceptual subscale of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief and the Magical Ideation scale). Our results were strong and separately replicable in different within-subjects and between-subjects conditions. However, a mediation analysis revealed that the reduction of the Ebbinghaus illusion was (statistically, hence without implying a causal relationship) entirely due to increased judgment time, i.e., the time subjects took to complete size comparisons. Judgment time increased with the strength of cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits, but subjects with longer judgment times had smaller illusions regardless of these traits. We argue that there are at least two possible accounts of our results. Reduced contextual integration might be due to a reduced ability to integrate context, as previously suggested; alternatively, it could be due to a reduced tendency to integrate context-that is, to a detail-oriented processing style. We offer predictions for future research, testable with a deadline experiment that pits these two accounts against one another. Regardless of which account proves to be best, our results show that contextual integration decreases with cognitive-perceptual schizotypal traits, and that this relationship is mediated by judgment time. Future studies should thus consider either manipulating or measuring this time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Abnormal perceptual experiences are central to schizophrenia, but the nature of these anomalies remains undetermined. We investigated contextual processing abnormalities across a comprehensive set of visual tasks. For perception of luminance, size, contrast, orientation, and motion, we quantified the degree to which the surrounding visual context altered a center stimulus's appearance. Healthy participants showed robust contextual effects across all tasks, as evidenced by pronounced misperceptions of center stimuli. Schizophrenia patients exhibited intact contextual modulations of luminance and size but showed weakened contextual modulations of contrast, performing more accurately than controls. Strong motion and orientation context effects correlated with worse symptoms and social functioning. Importantly, the overall strength of contextual modulation across tasks did not differ between controls and schizophrenia patients. In addition, performance measures across contextual tasks were uncorrelated, implying discrete underlying processes. These findings reveal that abnormal contextual modulation in schizophrenia is selective, arguing against the proposed unitary contextual processing dysfunction.

AB  - Anomalous perception has been investigated extensively in schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether these impairments are specific to schizophrenia or extend to other psychotic disorders. Recent studies of visual context processing in schizophrenia (Tibber et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013) point to circumscribed, task-specific abnormalities. Here we examined visual contextual processing across a comprehensive set of visual tasks in individuals with bipolar disorder and compared their performance with that of our previously published results from schizophrenia and healthy participants tested on those same tasks. We quantified the degree to which the surrounding visual context alters a center stimulus' appearance for brightness, size, contrast, orientation and motion. Across these tasks, healthy participants showed robust contextual effects, as indicated by pronounced misperceptions of the center stimuli. Participants with bipolar disorder showed contextual effects similar in magnitude to those found in healthy participants on all tasks. This result differs from what we found in schizophrenia participants (Yang et al., 2013) who showed weakened contextual modulations of contrast but intact contextual modulations of perceived luminance and size. Yet in schizophrenia participants, the magnitude of the contrast illusion did not correlate with symptom measures. Performance on the contrast task by the bipolar disorder group also could not be distinguished from that of the schizophrenia group, and this may be attributed to the result that bipolar patients who presented with greater manic symptoms showed weaker contrast modulation. Thus, contrast gain control may be modulated by clinical state in bipolar disorder. Stronger motion and orientation context effects correlated with worse clinical symptoms across both patient groups and especially in schizophrenia participants. These results highlight the complexity of visual context processing in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2013
AB  - Impairments in visual perceptual organization abilities are a repeatedly observed cognitive deficit in schizophrenia. These impairments have been found to be most prominent among patients with histories of poor premorbid social functioning, disorganized symptoms, and poor clinical outcomes. Despite the demonstration of significant sex differences for these clinical factors in schizophrenia, the extent of sex differences for visual perceptual organization in schizophrenia is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the extent to which previously known correlates (premorbid social sexual functioning and disorganized symptoms) and a novel factor (participant sex) accounted for performance on two perceptual organization tasks (contour integration and Ebbinghaus illusion) that have previously demonstrated sensitivity to schizophrenia. We also determined the relative degree to which each of these factors predicted task scores over and above the others. Schizophrenia patients (N = 109, 43 females) from different levels of care were ascertained. Female patients demonstrated higher contour integration scores, but lower performance on the context sensitivity index of the Ebbinghaus illusion, compared to males. Contour integration performance was significantly associated with poorer premorbid adolescent social sexual functioning and higher levels of disorganized symptoms, supporting past results that indicate a relationship among poor premorbid social sexual functioning, disorganized symptoms, and visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia. However, analyses of Ebbinghaus illusion performance suggests there is a complex relationship among patient sex, clinical factors and perceptual abilities with relatively intact bottom-up grouping processes in females, but greater problems, compared to males with more top-down mediated context sensitivity. Therefore, sex differences may be an important consideration for future studies of visual perceptual organization in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social cognitive impairment is prominent in schizophrenia, and it is closely related to functional outcome. Partly for these reasons, it has rapidly become a target for both training and psychopharmacological interventions. However, there is a paucity of reliable and valid social cognitive endpoints that can be used to evaluate treatment response in clinical trials. Also, clinical studies in schizophrenia have benefited rather little from the surge of activity and knowledge in nonclinical social neuroscience. The National Institute of Mental Health-sponsored study, "Social Cognition and Functioning in Schizophrenia" (SCAF), attempted to address this translational challenge by selecting paradigms from social neuroscience that could be adapted for use in schizophrenia. The project also evaluated the psychometric properties and external validity of the tasks to determine their suitability for multisite clinical trials. This first article in the theme section presents the goals, conceptual background, and rationale for the SCAF project. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: In the Ebbinghaus illusion, a shape appears larger than its actual size when surrounded by small shapes and smaller than its actual size when surrounded by large shapes. Resistance to this visual illusion has been previously reported in schizophrenia, and linked to disorganized symptoms and poorer prognosis in cross-sectional studies. It is unclear, however, when in the course of illness this resistance first emerges or how it varies longitudinally with illness phase. Method: We addressed these issues by having first-episode psychosis patients, multiple-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls complete a psychophysical task at two different time points, corresponding to hospital admission and discharge for patients. The task required judging the relative size of two circular targets centered on either side of the screen. Targets were presented without context (baseline), or were surrounded by shapes that made the size judgment harder or easier (misleading and helpful contexts, respectively). Context sensitivity was operationalized as the amount of improvement relative to baseline in the helpful condition minus the amount of decrement relative to baseline in the misleading condition. Results: At hospital admission, context sensitivity was lower in the multiple-episode group than in the other groups, and was marginally less in the first episode than in the control group. In addition, schizophrenia patients were significantly more and less accurate than the other groups in the misleading and helpful conditions, respectively. At discharge, all groups exhibited similar context sensitivity. In general, poorer context sensitivity was related to higher levels of disorganized symptoms, and lower level of depression, excitement, and positive symptoms. Discussion: Resistance to the Ebbinghaus illusion, as a characteristic of the acute phase of illness in schizophrenia, increases in magnitude after the first episode of psychosis. This suggests that visual context processing is a state-marker in schizophrenia and a biomarker of relapse and recovery. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The coherent organization of mental life depends on mechanisms for context-sensitive gain-control that are impaired in schizophrenia
AU  - Phillips, William A
AU  - Silverstein, Steven M
PY  - 2013
AB  - There is rapidly growing evidence that schizophrenia involves changes in context-sensitive gain-control and probabilistic inference. In addition to the well-known cognitive disorganization to which these changes lead, basic aspects of vision are also impaired, as discussed by other papers on this Frontiers Research Topic. The aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of such findings by examining five central hypotheses. First, context-sensitive gain-control is fundamental to brain function and mental life. Second, it occurs in many different regions of the cerebral cortex of many different mammalian species. Third, it has several computational functions, each with wide generality. Fourth, it is implemented by several neural mechanisms at cellular and circuit levels. Fifth, impairments of context-sensitive gain-control produce many of the well-known symptoms of schizophrenia and change basic processes of visual perception. These hypotheses suggest why disorders of vision in schizophrenia may provide insights into the nature and mechanisms of impaired reality testing and thought disorder in psychosis. They may also cast light on normal mental function and its neural bases. Limitations of these hypotheses, and ways in which they need further testing and development, are outlined.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that motion onset is very effective at capturing attention and is more salient than smooth motion. Here, we find that this salience ranking is present already in the firing rate of retinal ganglion cells. By stimulating the retina with a bar that appears, stays still, and then starts moving, we demonstrate that a subset of salamander retinal ganglion cells, fast OFF cells, responds significantly more strongly to motion onset than to smooth motion. We refer to this phenomenon as an alert response to motion onset. We develop a computational model that predicts the time-varying firing rate of ganglion cells responding to the appearance, onset, and smooth motion of a bar. This model, termed the adaptive cascade model, consists of a ganglion cell that receives input from a layer of bipolar cells, represented by individual rectified subunits. Additionally, both the bipolar and ganglion cells have separate contrast gain control mechanisms. This model captured the responses to our different motion stimuli over a wide range of contrasts,speeds, and locations.The alert response to motion onset, together with its computational model, introduces a new mechanism of sophisticated motion processing that occurs early in the visual system.

TI  - Inhibitory mechanisms that generate centre and surround properties in ON and off OFF brisk-sustained ganglion cells in the rabbit retina
AU  - Buldyrev, Ilya
AU  - Taylor, W. Rowland
PY  - 2013
AB  - Lateral inhibition produces the centre-surround organization of retinal receptive fields, in which inhibition driven by the mean luminance enhances the sensitivity of ganglion cells to spatial and temporal contrast. Surround inhibition is generated in both synaptic layers; however, the synaptic mechanisms within the inner plexiform layer are not well characterized within specific classes of retinal ganglion cell. Here, we compared the synaptic circuits generating concentric centre-surround receptive fields in ON and OFF brisk-sustained ganglion cells (BSGCs) in the rabbit retina. We first characterized the synaptic inputs to the centre of ON BSGCs, for comparison with previous results from OFF BSGCs. Similar to wide-field ganglion cells, the spatial extent of the excitatory centre and inhibitory surround was larger for the ON than the OFF BSGCs. The results indicate that the surrounds of ON and OFF BSGCs are generated in both the outer and the inner plexiform layers. The inner plexiform layer surround inhibition comprised GABAergic suppression of excitatory inputs from bipolar cells. However, ON and OFF BSGCs displayed notable differences. Surround suppression of excitatory inputs was weaker in ON than OFF BSGCs, and was mediated largely by GABAC receptors in ON BSGCs, and by both GABAA and GABAC receptors in OFF BSGCs. Large ON pathway-mediated glycinergic inputs to ON and OFF BSGCs also showed surround suppression, while much smaller GABAergic inputs showed weak, if any, spatial tuning. Unlike OFF BSGCs, which receive strong glycinergic crossover inhibition from the ON pathway, the ON BSGCs do not receive crossover inhibition from the OFF pathway. We compare and discuss possible roles for glycinergic inhibition in the two cell types. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - The 'unconscious' in paranoid delusional psychosis: Phenomenology, neuroscience, psychoanalysis
AU  - Mishara, Aaron L
PY  - 2012
AB  - In this contribution I present three overlapping approaches to the phenomenology of the unconscious (Conrad, Binswanger, Husserl). Conrad and Binswanger challenge the classical view that the delusional perception in schizophrenia is an abnormal symbolic meaning attached to an otherwise intact percept. Rather, a perceptual aspect or expressive (physiognomic) quality, detached from its visual context, becomes salient and develops into the delusion. Both believe that the delusional object involves a transformation of perceptual Gestalt-meaning on a "lower" unconscious phase of its development but they apply different methods. Conrad appeals to contemporary experimental work on microgenesis (Aktualgenese). Binswanger applies Husserl's "genetic" phenomenology. Conrad describes the delusional object as a pre-Gestalt (Vorgestalt), a physiognomic-expressive Gestalt-quality arrested at an earlier phase in the development of meaning which "normally'" remains unconscious so far as consciousness remains intact. For Binswanger, the "delusional object" is formed from a sensory profile-aspect (Abschattung) released during the loosening of the perceptual object's internal structure (it's "internal horizon" of meaning). The phenomenological unconscious (Husserl) is two-pronged: it is both what underlies the lowermost background of any emergent Gestalt in the present, but it is also the past, the night of the unconscious, into which every emergent saliency passes. Time-consciousness is not the passive self-affection of pre-reflective self-awareness (M. Henry) but requires the unconscious relationship between present and past selves in the ongoing movement of self-transcendence. It is this self-transcendence which is both compromised and preserved by the metaphoric meaning of the delusional object in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Electrical stimulation of retinal neurons offers the possibility of partial restoration of visual function. Challenges in neuroprosthetic applications are the long-term stability of the metal-based devices and the physiological activation of retinal circuitry. In this study, we demonstrate electrical stimulation of different classes of retinal neurons with a multicapacitor array. The array-insulated by an inert oxide-allows for safe stimulation with monophasic anodal or cathodal current pulses of low amplitude. Ex vivo rabbit retinas were interfaced in either epiretinal or subretinal configuration to the multicapacitor array. The evoked activity was recorded from ganglion cells that respond to light increments by an extracellular tungsten electrode. First, a monophasic epiretinal cathodal or a subretinal anodal current pulse evokes a complex burst of action potentials in ganglion cells. The first action potential occurs within 1 ms and is attributed to direct stimulation. Within the next milliseconds additional spikes are evoked through bipolar cell or photoreceptor depolarization, as confirmed by pharmacological blockers. Second, monophasic epiretinal anodal or subretinal cathodal currents elicit spikes in ganglion cells by hyperpolarization of photoreceptor terminals. These stimuli mimic the photoreceptor response to light increments. Third, the stimulation symmetry between current polarities (anodal/cathodal) and retina-array configuration (epi/sub) is confirmed in an experiment in which stimuli presented at different positions reveal the center-surround organization of the ganglion cell. A simple biophysical model that relies on voltage changes of cell terminals in the transretinal electric field above the stimulation capacitor explains our results. This study provides a comprehensive guide for efficient stimulation of different retinal neuronal classes with low-amplitude capacitive currents.

AB  - Dysfunctional prediction in sensory processing has been suggested as a possible causal mechanism in the development of delusions in patients with schizophrenia. Previous studies in healthy subjects have shown that while the perception of apparent motion can mask visual events along the illusory motion trace, such motion masking is reduced when events are spatio-temporally compatible with the illusion, and, therefore, predictable. Here we tested the hypothesis that this specific detection advantage for predictable target stimuli on the apparent motion trace is reduced in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. Our data show that, although target detection along the illusory motion trace is generally impaired, both patients and healthy control participants detect predictable targets more often than unpredictable targets. Patients had a stronger motion masking effect when compared to controls. However, patients showed the same advantage in the detection of predictable targets as healthy control subjects. Our findings reveal stronger motion masking but intact prediction of visual events along the apparent motion trace in patients with paranoid schizophrenia and suggest that the sensory prediction mechanism underlying apparent motion is not impaired in paranoid schizophrenia.

AB  - It has been postulated that horizontal cells (HCs) send feedback signals onto cones via a proton feedback mechanism, which generates the center-surround receptive field of bipolar cells, and color-opponent signals in many non-mammalian vertebrates. Here we used a strong pH buffer, HEPES, to reduce extra-cellular proton concentration changes and so determine whether protons mediate color-opponent signals in goldfish H3 (triphasic) HCs. Superfusion with 10 mM HEPES-fortified saline elicited depolarization of H3 HCs' dark membrane potential and enhanced hyperpolarizing responses to blue stimuli, but suppressed both depolarization by yellow and orange and hyperpolarization by red stimuli. The response components suppressed by HEPES resembled the inverse of spectral responses of H2 (biphasic) HCs. These results are consistent with the Stell-Lightfoot cascade model, in which the HEPES-suppressed component of H3 HCs was calculated using light responses recorded experimentally in H1 (monophasic) and H2 HCs. Selective suppression of long- or long- + middle-wavelength cone signals by long-wavelength background enhanced the responses to short-wavelength stimuli. These results suggest that HEPES inhibited color opponent signals in H3 HCs, in which the source of opponent-color signals is primarily a feedback from H2 HCs and partly from H1 HCs onto short-wavelength cones, probably mediated by protons.

AB  - The gain of signaling in primary sensory circuits is matched to the stimulus intensity by the process of adaptation. Retinal neural circuits adapt to visual scene statistics, including the mean (background adaptation) and the temporal variance (contrast adaptation) of the light stimulus. The intrinsic properties of retinal bipolar cells and synapses contribute to background and contrast adaptation, but it is unclear whether both forms of adaptation depend on the same cellular mechanisms. Studies of bipolar cell synapses identified synaptic mechanisms of gain control, but the relevance of these mechanisms to visual processing is uncertain because of the historical focus on fast, phasic transmission rather than the tonic transmission evoked by ambient light. Here, we studied use-dependent regulation of bipolar cell synaptic transmission evoked by small, ongoing modulations of membrane potential (VM) in the physiological range. We made paired whole-cell recordings from rod bipolar (RB) and AII amacrine cells in a mouse retinal slice preparation. Quasi-white noise voltage commands modulated RB VM and evoked EPSCs in the AII. We mimicked changes in background luminance or contrast, respectively, by depolarizing the VM or increasing its variance. A linear systems analysis of synaptic transmission showed that increasing either the mean or the variance of the presynaptic VM reduced gain. Further electrophysiological and computational analyses demonstrated that adaptation to mean potential resulted from both Ca channel inactivation and vesicle depletion, whereas adaptation to variance resulted from vesicle depletion alone. Thus, background and contrast adaptation apparently depend in part on a common synaptic mechanism. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2011
AB  - In sensory systems, neurons are generally characterized by their receptive field, namely the sensitivity to activity patterns at the input of the circuit. To assess the role of the neuron in the system, one must also know its projective field, namely the spatiotemporal effects the neuron exerts on all of the outputs of the circuit. We studied both the receptive and projective fields of an amacrine interneuron in the salamander retina. This amacrine type has a sustained OFF response with a small receptive field, but its output projects over a much larger region. Unlike other amacrine cells, this type is remarkably promiscuous and affects nearly every ganglion cell within reach of its dendrites. Its activity modulates the sensitivity of visual responses in ganglion cells but leaves their kinetics unchanged. The projective field displays a center-surround structure: depolarizing a single amacrine suppresses the visual sensitivity of ganglion cells nearby and enhances it at greater distances. This change in sign is seen even within the receptive field of one ganglion cell; thus, the modulation occurs presynaptically on bipolar cell terminals, most likely via GABAB receptors. Such an antagonistic projective field could contribute to the mechanisms of the retina for predictive coding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2011
AB  - Receptive field organization of cone-driven bipolar cells was investigated by intracellular recording in the intact light-adapted retina of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). Centered spots and concentric annuli of optimum dimensions were used to selectively stimulate the receptive field center and surround with sinusoidal modulations of contrast at 3 Hz. At low contrasts, responses of both the center and surround of both ON and OFF bipolar cells were linear, showing high gain and thus contrast enhancement relative to cones. The contrast/response curves for the fundamental response, measured by a Fast Fourier Transform, reached half maximum amplitude quickly at 13% contrast followed by saturation at high contrasts. The variation of the normalized amplitude of the center and surround responses was remarkably similar, showing linear regression over the entire response range with very high correlations, r2 = 0.97 for both ON and OFF cells. The contrast/response curves of both center and surround for both ON and OFF cells were well fit (r2 = 0.98) by an equation for single-site binding. In about half the cells studied, the nonlinear waveforms of center and surround could be brought into coincidence by scaling and shifting the surround response in time. This implies that a nonlinearity, common to both center and surround, occurs after polarity inversion at the cone feedback synapse. Evidence from paired whole-cell recordings between single cones and OFF bipolar cells suggests that substantial nonlinearity is not due to transmission at the cone synapse but instead arises from intrinsic bipolar cell and network mechanisms. When sinusoidal contrast modulations were applied to the center and surround simultaneously, clear additivity was observed for small responses in both ON and OFF cells, whereas the interaction was strikingly nonadditive for large responses. The contribution of the surround was then greatly reduced, suggesting attenuation at the cone feedback synapse. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Horizontal cells (HCs) are involved in establishing the center-surround receptive field organization of photoreceptor and bipolar cells. In many species, HCs respond differentially to colors and may play a role in color vision. An earlier study from our laboratory suggested that four types of HCs exist in the zebrafish retina: three cone HCs (H1, H2 and H3) and one rod HC. In this study, we describe their photoreceptor connections. Cones are arranged in a mosaic in which rows of alternating blue (B)- and ultraviolet (UV)- sensitive single cones alternate with rows of red (R)- and green (G)-sensitive double cones; the G cones are adjacent to UV cones and B cones adjacent to R cones. Two small-field (H1 and H2) and two large-field (H3 and rod HC) cells were observed. The cone HC dendritic terminals connected to cones with single boutons, doublets, or rosettes, whereas the rod HCs connected to rods with single boutons. The single boutons/doublets/rosettes of cone HCs were arranged in double rows separated by single rows for H1 cells, in pairs and singles for H2 cells, and in a rectilinear pattern for H3 cells. These connectivity patterns suggest that H1 cells contact R, G, and B cones, H2 cells G, B, and UV cones, and H3 cells B and UV cones. These predictions were confirmed by applying the Dil method to SWS1-GFP retinas whose UV cones express green fluorescent protein. Each rod HC was adjacent to the soma or axon of a Dil-labeled cone HC and connected to 50-200 rods. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In the primate retina the small bistratified, "blue-yellow" color-opponent ganglion cell receives parallel ON-depolarizing and OFF-hyperpolarizing inputs from short (S)-wavelength sensitive and combined long (L)- and middle (M)-wavelength sensitive cone photoreceptors, respectively. However, the synaptic pathways that create S versus LM cone-opponent receptive field structure remain controversial. Here, we show in the macaque monkey retina in vitro that at photopic light levels, when an identified rod input is excluded, the small bistratified cell displays a spatially coextensive receptive field in which the S-ON-input is in spatial, temporal, and chromatic balance with the LM-OFF-input. ON pathway block with L-AP-4, the mGluR6 receptor agonist, abolished the S-ON response but spared the LM-OFF response. The isolated LM component showed a center-surround receptive field structure consistent with an input from OFF-center, ON-surround "diffuse" cone bipolar cells. Increasing retinal buffering capacity with HEPES attenuated the LM-ON surround component, consistent with a non-GABAergic outer retina feedback mechanism for the bipolar surround. The GABAa/c receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine did not affect chromatic balance or the basic coextensive receptive field structure, suggesting that the LM-OFF field is not generated by an inner retinal inhibitory pathway. We conclude that the opponent S-ON and LM-OFF responses originate from the excitatory receptive field centers of S-ON and LM-OFF cone bipolar cells, and that the LM-OFF- and ON-surrounds of these parallel bipolar inputs largely cancel, explaining the small, spatially coextensive but spectrally antagonistic receptive field structure of the blue-ON ganglion cell.

PY  - 2009
AB  - We propose a new retina simulation software, called Virtual Retina, which transforms a video into spike trains. Our goal is twofold: Allow large scale simulations (up to 100,000 neurons) in reasonable processing times and keep a strong biological plausibility, taking into account implementation constraints. The underlying model includes a linear model of filtering in the Outer Plexiform Layer, a shunting feedback at the level of bipolar cells accounting for rapid contrast gain control, and a spike generation process modeling ganglion cells. We prove the pertinence of our software by reproducing several experimental measurements from single ganglion cells such as cat X and Y cells. This software will be an evolutionary tool for neuroscientists that need realistic large-scale input spike trains in subsequent treatments, and for educational purposes.

TI  - Receptive fields of retinal bipolar cells are mediated by heterogeneous synaptic circuitry
AU  - Zhang, Ai-Jun
AU  - Wu, Samuel M
PY  - 2009
AB  - Center-surround antagonistic receptive field (CSARF) organization is the basic synaptic circuit that serves as elementary building blocks for spatial information processing in the visual system. Cells with such receptive fields converge into higher-order visual neurons to form more complex receptive fields. Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) are the first neurons along the visual pathway that exhibit CSARF organization. BCs have been classified according to their response polarities and rod/cone inputs, and they project signals to target cells at different sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer. On the other hand, CSARFs of various types of BCs have been assumed be organized the same way. Here we examined center and surround responses of over 250 salamander BCs, and demonstrated that different types of BCs exhibit different patterns of dye coupling, receptive field center size, surround response strength, and conductance changes associated with center and surround responses. We show that BC receptive field center sizes varied with the degree of BC-BC coupling, and that surround responses of different BCs are mediated by different combinations of five lateral synaptic pathways mediated by the horizontal cells and amacrine cells. The finding of heterogeneous receptive field circuitry fundamentally challenges the common assumption that CSARFs of different subtypes of visual neurons are mediated by the same synaptic pathways. BCs carrying different visual signals use different synaptic circuits to process spatial information, allowing shape and contrast computation be differentially modulated by various lighting and adaptation conditions.

TI  - Functional circuitry of visual adaptation in the retina
AU  - Demb, Jonathan B
PY  - 2008
AB  - The visual system continually adjusts its sensitivity, or 'adapts', to the conditions of the immediate environment. Adaptation increases responses when input signals are weak, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and decreases responses when input signals are strong, to prevent response saturation. Retinal ganglion cells adapt primarily to two properties of light input: the mean intensity and the variance of intensity over time (contrast). This review focuses on cellular mechanisms for contrast adaptation in mammalian retina. High contrast over the ganglion cell's receptive field centre reduces the gain of spiking responses. The mechanism for gain control arises partly in presynaptic bipolar cell inputs and partly in the process of spike generation. Following strong contrast stimulation, ganglion cells exhibit a prolonged after-hyperpolarization, driven primarily by suppression of glutamate release from presynaptic bipolar cells. Ganglion cells also adapt to high contrast over their peripheral receptive field. Long-range adaptive signals are carried by amacrine cells that inhibit the ganglion cell directly, causing hyperpolarization, and inhibit presynaptic bipolar terminals, reducing gain of their synaptic output. Thus, contrast adaptation in ganglion cells involves multiple synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms for gain control and hyperpolarization. Several forms of adaptation in ganglion cells originate in presynaptic bipolar cells. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2008
AB  - Visual neurons adapt to increases in stimulus contrast by reducing their response sensitivity and decreasing their integration time, a collective process known as 'contrast gain control.' In retinal ganglion cells, gain control arises at two stages: an intrinsic mechanism related to spike generation, and a synaptic mechanism in retinal pathways. Here, we tested whether gain control is expressed similarly by three synaptic pathways that converge on an OFF alpha/Y-type ganglion cell: excitatory inputs driven by OFF cone bipolar cells; inhibitory inputs driven by ON cone bipolar cells; and inhibitory inputs driven by rod bipolar cells. We made whole-cell recordings of membrane current in guinea pig ganglion cells in vitro. At high contrast, OFF bipolar cell-mediated excitatory input reduced gain and shortened integration time. Inhibitory input was measured by clamping voltage near 0 mV or by recording in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) antagonists to isolate the following circuit: cone -> ON cone bipolar cell -> AII amacrine cell -> OFF ganglion cell. At high contrast, this input reduced gain with no effect on integration time.Mean luminance was reduced 1000-fold to recruit the rod bipolar pathway: rod -> rod bipolar cell -> AII cell -> OFF ganglion cell. The spiking response, measured with loose-patch recording, adapted despite essentially no gain control in synaptic currents. Thus, cone bipolar-driven pathways adapt differently, with kinetic effects confined to the excitatory OFF pathway. The ON bipolar-mediated inhibition reduced gain at high contrast by a mechanism that did not require an iGluR. Under rod bipolar-driven conditions, ganglion cell firing showed gain control that was explained primarily by an intrinsic property. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

PY  - 2008
AB  - Over the past several years working in a milieu of schizophrenia-oriented research and medical venues, we have witnessed a number of incidents in which a commonly occurring medical phenomenon known as myodesopsia (i.e., floaters), leads to considerable confusion when rating perceptual abnormalities, even among the most seasoned of diagnosticians. Floaters occur when the vitreous, a gel-like substance that fills the eye, slowly shrinks and becomes stringy; the resulting strands can cast tiny shadows on the retina. There are the consistencies in the nature of a floater, which we have found to be very useful when distinguishing it from a genuine perceptual abnormality. The reliable and valid assessment of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders is a challenging and continuously evolving process; open communication between and among researchers and clinicians with phenomena such as floaters improve the reliability of research into visual illusions or perceptual distortions.

AB  - Genetically encoded optical neuromodulators create an opportunity for circuit-specific intervention in neurological diseases. One of the diseases most amenable to this approach is retinal degeneration, where the loss of photoreceptors leads to complete blindness. To restore photosensitivity, we genetically targeted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2, to second-order neurons, ON bipolar cells, of degenerated retinas in vivo in the Pde6brd1 (also known as rd1) mouse model. In the absence of 'classical' photoreceptors, we found that ON bipolar cells that were engineered to be photosensitive induced light-evoked spiking activity in ganglion cells. The rescue of light sensitivity was selective to the ON circuits that would naturally respond to increases in brightness. Despite degeneration of the outer retina, our intervention restored transient responses and center-surround organization of ganglion cells. The resulting signals were relayed to the visual cortex and were sufficient for the animals to successfully perform optomotor behavioral tasks.

AB  - The primate visual system consists of parallel pathways initiated by distinct cell types in the retina that encode different features of the visual scene. Small bistratified cells (SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow-OFF [S-ON/(L+M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high-acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center-surround spatial structure, with the (L+M)-OFF component of the receptive field ~50% larger in diameter than the S-ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S-ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF-parasol cells. The (L+M)-OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L-APB. These observations indicate that the (L+M)-OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF-bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON-parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Retinal ganglion cells fire spikes to an appropriate contrast presented over their receptive field center. These center responses undergo dynamic changes in sensitivity depending on the ongoing level of contrast, a process known as "contrast gain control." Extracellular recordings suggested that gain control is driven by a single wide-field mechanism, extending across the center and beyond, that depends on inhibitory interneurons: amacrine cells. However, recordings in salamander suggested that the excitatory bipolar cells, which drive the center, may themselves show gain control independently of amacrine cell mechanisms. Here, we tested in mammalian ganglion cells whether amacrine cells are critical for gain control over the receptive field center. We made extracellular and whole-cell recordings of guinea pig Y-type cells in vitro and quantified the gain change between contrasts using a linear-nonlinear analysis. For spikes, tripling contrast reduced gain by ~40%. With spikes blocked, ganglion cells showed similar levels of gain control in membrane currents and voltages and under conditions of low and high calcium buffering: tripling contrast reduced gain by ~20-25%. Gain control persisted under voltage-clamp conditions that minimize inhibitory conductances and pharmacological conditions that block inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. Gain control depended on adequate stimulation, not of ganglion cells but of presynaptic bipolar cells. Furthermore, horizontal cell measurements showed a lack of gain control in photoreceptor synaptic release. Thus, the mechanism for gain control over the ganglion cell receptive field center, as measured in the subthreshold response, originates in the presynaptic bipolar cells and does not require amacrine cell signaling.

This book is the first to examine key topics and research in involuntary memory. Topics discussed include involuntary memories in everyday life, across the life span, and in the laboratory; the special ways in which involuntary memories sometimes manifest themselves such as in voluntary remembering, or in clinical syndromes like posttraumatic stress disorder; and a number of theoretical treatments. The authors present research on topics such as autobiographical memory; consciousness and memory; aging and memory; depression; and psychosis.

AB  - Comments on an article by Pomarol-Clotet et al (see record 2006-10900-016). Pomarol-Clotet et al reported a range of perceptual distortions in healthy volunteers following ketamine administration but did not report hallucinations. They concluded that ketamine does not reproduce the full picture of schizophrenia, but there are similarities in terms of referential thinking and negative symptoms. We also recently studied healthy volunteers following ketamine administration (Stone et al, 2006) and, although previously unpublished, recorded phenomenological changes, including verbatim descriptions of their experiences. In keeping with Pomarol-Clotet et al, ketamine induced a wide range of abnormal perceptual experiences. However, no volunteers reported true hallucinations, although several reported eidetic imagery, and most reported visual illusions. Most experienced severe distortions of time, believing that a minute was several hours in duration. They also showed blunting of affect and loss of emotional reactivity. Although we agree with Pomarol-Clotet et al that these drug-induced effects do not correspond directly to schizophrenic symptoms, we feel it would be remarkable if ketamine administration were to completely reproduce the idiopathic condition.

PY  - 2006
AB  - Effective sensory processing requires matching the gain of neural responses to the range of signals encountered. For rod vision, gain controls operate at light levels at which photons arrive rarely at individual rods, light levels too low to cause adaptation in rod phototransduction. Under these conditions, adaptation within a conserved pathway in mammalian retina maintains sensitivity as light levels change. To relate retinal signals to behavioral work on detection at low light levels, we measured how background light affects the gain and noise of primate ganglion cells. To determine where and how gain is controlled, we tracked rod-mediated signals across the mouse retina. These experiments led to three main conclusions: (1) the primary site of adaptation at low light levels is the synapse between rod bipolar and AII amacrine cells; (2) cellular noise after the gain control is nearly independent of background intensity; and (3) at low backgrounds, noise in the circuitry, rather than rod noise or fluctuations in arriving photons, limits ganglion cell sensitivity. This work provides physiological insights into the rich history of experiments characterizing how rod vision avoids saturation as light levels increase.

TI  - Relating clinical trials to psychiatric practice: Part I: The case of a 13-year old on aripiprazole and fluoxetine
AU  - Preskorn, Sheldon H
PY  - 2003
AB  - This first part of a two-part series presents a case that illustrates some of the difficulties that arise in extrapolating from the results of new drug registration trials to the real world of psychiatric practice. The patient was a 13-yr-old boy admitted to the hospital following an alleged suicide attempt. This was his 3rd admission over the preceding year. His first psychiatric hospitalization occurred at age 12 yrs and was occasioned by reports of persecutory hallucinations (PHs) and delusions. Upon discharge from his second admission, his diagnosis was schizoaffective disorder, with his medication regimen at that time being aripiprazole (60 mg/d) and fluoxetine (60 mg/d). At the 3rd admission he described PHs, visual illusions, and multiple nonsystematized or nonintegrated bizarre delusions principally involving family members. This article points out the complexity of interactions that can occur between just two drugs used in combination. Clinicians by necessity must frequently use medications in patients and situations what are quite different from the ones studied in drug registration trials. The importance of therapeutic drug monitoring is stressed. Uncertainty arises in determining whether a less than optional outcome occurs in spite of vs because of a treatment plan.

PY  - 2000
AB  - The authors submit a case report of a 62-yr-old male with an 18-mo history of a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. The patient experienced acute mental status changes which the authors conclude resulted from a regimen of quetiapine fumarate. He was started on quetiapine with incremental increases over 1 wk and was on 300 mg daily (twice daily dosing) for 3 days. Then for 4 days he experienced an inability to concentrate, distractibility, sleep-wake reversal, visual illusions of seeing a pen "become nothing" and appear "mushy," and tactile hallucinations of feeling a pen in his hand. Substance-induced delirium was the provisional diagnosis. The symptoms resolved within 48 hrs after discontinuing quetiapine. The close temporal relationship between onset of symptoms within 3 days of the 300 mg dosing and the resolution within 2 days following discontinuation leads the authors to associate quetiapine with the adverse mental changes. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of acute confusional states occurring during the initiation of quetiapine. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Temporal contrast adaptation in salamander bipolar cells
AU  - Rieke, Fred
PY  - 2001
AB  - This work investigates how the light responses of salamander bipolar cells adapt to changes in temporal contrast: changes in the depth of the temporal fluctuations in light intensity about the mean. Contrast affected the sensitivity of bipolar cells but not of photoreceptors or horizontal cells, suggesting that adaptation occurred in signal transfer from photoreceptors to bipolars. This suggestion was confirmed by recording from photoreceptor- bipolar pairs and observing a direct dependence of the gain of signal transfer on the contrast of the light input. After an increase in contrast, the onset of adaptation in the bipolar cell had a time constant of 1-2 sec, similar to a fast component of contrast adaptation in the light responses of retinal ganglion cells (Kim and Rieke, 2001). Contrast adaptation was mediated by processes in the dendrites of both ON and OFF bipolars. The functional properties of adaptation differed for the two bipolar types, however, with contrast having a much more pronounced effect on the kinetics of the responses of OFF cells than ON cells.

AB  - Reports center-surround receptive fields of identified cone bipolar cells in the macaque monkey retina. In the peripheral retina, cone bipolar cell nuclei were labeled in vitro with diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI), targeted for recording under microscopic control, and anatomically identified by intracellular staining. Identified cells included 'diffuse' bipolar cells, which contact multiple cones, and 'midget' bipolar cells, which contact a single cone. Responses to flickering spots and annuli revealed a clear surround: both hyperpolarizing (OFF) and depolarizing (ON) cells responded with reversed polarity to annular stimuli. Center and surround dimensions were calculated for 12 bipolar cells from the spatial frequency response to drifting, sinusoidal luminance modulated gratings. Surrounds were around 10 times larger in diameter than centers and in most cases the ratio of center to surround strength was -1. It is suggested that the center-surround receptive fields of the major primate ganglion cell types are established at the bipolar cell, probably by the circuitry of the outer retina.

PY  - 1999
AB  - A retinal ganglion cell commonly expresses two spatially overlapping receptive field mechanisms. One is the familiar "center/surround," which sums excitation and inhibition across a region somewhat broader than the ganglion cell's dendritic field. This mechanism responds to a drifting grating by modulating firing at the drift frequency (linear response). Less familiar is the "nonlinear" mechanism, which sums the rectified output of many small subunits that extend for millimeters beyond the dendritic field. This mechanism responds to a contrast-reversing grating by modulating firing at twice the reversal frequency (nonlinear response). We investigated this nonlinear mechanism by presenting visual stimuli to the intact guinea pig retina in vitro while recording intracellularly from large brisk and sluggish ganglion cells. A contrast-reversing grating modulated the membrane potential (in addition to the firing rate) at twice the reversal frequency. This response was initially hyperpolarizing for some cells (either ON or OFF center) and initially depolarizing for others. Experiments in which responses to bars were summed in-phase or out-of-phase suggested that the single class of bipolar cells (either ON or OFF) that drives the center/surround response also drives the nonlinear response. Consistent with this, nonlinear responses persisted in OFF ganglion cells when ON bipolar cell responses were blocked by L-AP-4. Nonlinear responses evoked from millimeters beyond the ganglion cell were eliminated by tetrodotoxin. Thus, to relay the response from distant regions of the receptive field requires a spiking interneuron. Nonlinear responses from different regions of the receptive field added linearly.

It is suggested that intramuscular/ly (im) midazolam is rapidly effective, is well tolerated, has relatively few side effect risks, has a short half-life, and allows the clinical to gain control of the acute crisis.

TI  - Blockade of glutamate-mediated activity in the developing retina perturbs the functional segregation of ON and OFF pathways
AU  - Bisti, Silvia
AU  - Gargini, Claudia
AU  - Chalupa, Leo M
PY  - 1998
AB  - The dendrites of ganglion cells initially ramify throughout the inner plexiform layer of the developing retina before becoming stratified into ON or OFF sublaminae. This ontogenetic event is thought to depend on glutamate-mediated afferent activity, because treating the developing retina with the glutamate analog 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB), which hyperpolarizes ON cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells, thereby preventing their release of glutamate, effectively arrests the dendritic stratification process. To assess the functional consequences of this manipulation, extracellular recordings were made from single cells in the A laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and from the optic tract in mature cats that had received intraocular injections of APB during the first postnatal month. Such recordings revealed that stimulation of the APB-treated eye evoked both ON as well as OFF discharges in 37% of the cells tested. (As expected, when the normal eye was activated, virtually all cells yielded only ON or OFF responses.) The proportion of ON-OFF cells found here corresponds closely to the incidence of multistratified dendrites observed previously in anatomical studies of APB-treated cat retinas. This suggests that the ganglion cells with multistratified dendrites receive functional inputs from ON as well as OFF cone bipolar cells. This interpretation is further supported by the finding that the proportion of ON-OFF cells was very similar in the geniculate layer innervated by the treated eye and in the optic tract. The cells activated by the APB-treated eye were also found not to show response suppression when flashing stimuli of increasing size were used. This suggests that exposing the developing retina to APB perturbs the neural circuitry mediating the antagonistic center-surround organization found in normal receptive fields. The functional changes evident after treating the developing retina with APB suggest that it should now be feasible to assess how the segregation of ON and OFF retinal pathways relates to organizational features at higher levels of the visual system, such as orientation selectivity in cortical cells.

Red-green opponency (as measured by the depth of a notch at 580 nm) was removed by intravitreal injection of bicuculline but not by strychnine. Therefore, red-green opponency is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and not glycine. The depth of the notch was dependent on stimulus size. Red-green opponency was carried by the on and not the off bipolar pathways of the retina. Red and green annuli selectively reduced red and green inhibition, as though there were selective reduction of the surround response in center-surround organized red-green receptive fields.

Korsakoffs were most impaired in their scaling of olfactory and gustatory stimuli but did evidence some mild impairments on 2 of the 3 visual tasks. In contrast, right-hemisphere lesion patients were impaired on all 3 visual tasks and on an auditory task, but they scaled olfactory and gustatory stimuli in a normal manner. This dissociation indicated that the Korsakoffs' difficulties with the chemical senses cannot be attributed to the complexity of the tests.

Responses were scored for presence or absence of specific perceptual and thinking disturbances, using verbatim typescripts and a standard raters' manual. Compared to nonschizophrenics, schizophrenics more often reported changes in the following: thought blocking which disrupts speech; mental fatigue; inability to focus attention; attribution of impaired concentration to factors other than preoccupation; visual illusions; misidentification of people; language not understood; more acute auditory perception; and impaired perception of speech. One-half of the schizophrenics reported an attentional deficit similar to that proposed by A. McGhie and J. Chapman as the primary disorder in schizophrenia.

Cells were identified by injection of Lucifer yellow. Rod spectral sensitivity functions conformed to the density spectrum of a 524-nm pigment, those of cones to that of a 612-nm pigment. Horizontal cell responses reflected both these classes of photoreceptor input. Rod input evoked a slow waveform, cone input a faster waveform. In the mesopic state the horizontal response reflected both waveforms. A steady weak green background greatly enhanced the response to a superimposed red flash, but not the reverse. A 3rd photoreceptor type provided input to a chromatic bipolar cell that was hyperpolarized by blue light and depolarized by red light. These chromatic bipolars had broad areas of spatial integration and lacked center-surround organization. (15 ref) (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Cells with color opponency in each of 2 spatially antagonistic parts of their receptive fields have been found at various stages of the visual pathways in several animal species. These cells, which are said to have "double color-opponent receptive fields," are thought to play a major role in the analysis of colored images by enhancing simultaneous color contrast. This stage of information processing was heretofore considered to begin at the level of retinal ganglion cells. However, in the carp at least, this stage occurs earlier, as double color-opponent receptive fields have been found among the retinal bipolar cells of this animal.

TI  - Size estimation in paranoid and nonparanoid schizophrenics: A test of the stimulus redundancy formulation interpretation
AU  - Asarnow, Robert F
AU  - Mann, Robert
PY  - 1978
AB  - 15 paranoid and 15 nonparanoid schizophrenics and 15 normal controls were administered a size estimation task which featured 2 administrations of nonthematic standard stimuli presented under 3 conditions of background stimuli: (a) surrounded by 4 smaller stimuli of the same kind; (b) surrounded by 4 larger stimuli of the same kind; and (c) presented without background stimuli. Standard stimuli were presented at exposure times of 33 and 4,000 msec. On the 1st administration, nonparanoid schizophrenics overestimated size relative to paranoid schizophrenics; normal controls were intermediate in performance between the paranoid and nonparanoid schizophrenics, particularly on longer stimulus exposure times. The groups did not differ on the 2nd administration. Results suggest that the repeated administration of size estimation procedures in which the effects of sequence and thematic content stimuli were inextricably confounded may have contributed to recent conflicting findings in the size estimation literature. Contrary to predictions generated by R. L. Cromwell's (1972) stimulus redundancy formulation, the paranoid schizophrenics were not more affected by the size of the background stimuli than the nonparanoid schizophrenics.

PY  - 1977
AB  - Recorded visually evoked potentials from bipolar electrodes implanted in the foveal and parafoveal striate, prestriate, and inferotemporal cortices of 2 mature rhesus monkeys. The stimuli used were a blank field and 3 checkerboard patterns containing checks whose sizes were 2degree 24', 36degree 9' of visual arc. In addition to the size of the checks within the patterns, the intensity at which the stimuli were presented was also varied. In all 4 regions studied, check size had a significant effect on the amplitude of the average evoked potential, but intensity showed an effect only in the 2 striate regions. Certain regions of the visual cortex can apparently process 2 dimensions of a stimulus concurrently, and the same mass of neuronal tissue can participate in the processing of different dimensions of a stimulus at different times. Results are discussed in the context of existing literature concerning the evoked potential as an indicator of sensory information processing.

AB  - Administered a battery of test protocols designed to estimate own and peer's height on a 5-point Likert scale. Each of 69 male 12-15 yr olds evaluated himself and all other Ss on the bipolar adjective short-tall, embedded with 18 other bipolar qualifiers to mask the height scale. Although no relationship was found between the actual height of Ss and their self-esteem, positive and significant relationships were found between their own, peers', and teacher's perceptions of their height and self-esteem. Results are discussed with reference to the relationship between body morphology, behavior, and personality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - A quasi-paranoid feature of students' extreme attitudes against colonialism
AU  - Alker, Henry A
PY  - 1971
AB  - Tested 3 alternative explanations concerning an apparent paranoid quality of extreme political attitudes: (a) such attitudes reflect exceptional, if embarrassing, perceptiveness by their proponents; (b) such attitudes reflect a cognitive style similar to that of paranoids without any attendant defensiveness; and (c) such attitudes represent paranoid defensiveness. Results with a selected total sample of 96 "left," "middle," and "right" undergraduates support only the 3rd hypothesis. Findings suggest that paranoid-like functioning was most prevalent in those on the extreme left. Paranoid defensiveness was indicated through an interaction with manipulated suspicion-arousal during assessment. Restrictions concerning the generalities of these results are discussed. (29 ref.)

AB  - A device providing for the direct measurement of perceived body size has been developed. 41 Ss (20 nonpatient controls, and 21 psychotic patients) estimated the bodily dimensions of height, width, and depth with the aid of this device. There were no patient-control differences, sex differences, or session differences in the errors of estimate. The descending estimates were greater than the corresponding ascending estimates of all 3 dimensions. The descending estimates were significantly different from the true dimensions of height and depth, while the ascending estimes were not. Overall estimates were significantly different from the measurements of actual height. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The following hypotheses were tested: (a) Schizophrenics (N = 25) will produce less accurate size-judgments than normals (N = 25). (b) Schizophrenic patients who have made poor premorbid sexual and social adjustments will produce less accurate size-judgments than those who have made good adjustments. The results show that, although schizophrenics did not differ from normals in mean size estimates (pictures of thematic content), they did show greater variance. Good and poor "premorbids" differed markedly from each other, the former tending to diminish and the latter to enlarge size. 26 references.

TI  - Some aspects of permissiveness in psychotherapy of children
AU  - Jessner, Lucie
PY  - 1950
AB  - Permissiveness in psychotherapy is shown to have both a necessary positive function, and also certain hazards and dangers. Psychiatrists can prevent most of the negative effects of unlimited permissiveness (1) if therapy is defined as a special experience, stressing play-acting; (2) if the transference relationship does not get out of bounds on the part of the therapist, and (3) if the therapist consistently strives to make the child aware of the meaning of his actions. Therapy, seen as a gradual transition from the pleasure principle to the reality principle, allows permissiveness on the part of the therapist to be seen as a necessary, intermediate stage which promotes the learning process of the child to gain control of his impulses.

PY  - 1928
AB  - After a very brief treatment of the botany and chemistry of mescal, Kluver deals with the characteristics of mescal visions, indicates some of the effects of mescal intoxication in other than the visual sense fields, describes the so-called mescal psychosis, and finally suggests problems of a psychological nature for future research. By far the greater part of the essay is taken up by a description of the characteristic visual effects of mescal. Here Kluver draws upon the experimental investigations of others and supplements these by observations derived from his own experience. An attempt is made to work out constant characteristics in the form, movement and color of the visual illusions experienced by different observers. Some remarks are included concerning the possible likeness of peyoteinduced visions and certain of the outstanding features of eidetic imagery.
